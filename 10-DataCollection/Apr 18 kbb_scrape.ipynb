All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first.\",\n",
