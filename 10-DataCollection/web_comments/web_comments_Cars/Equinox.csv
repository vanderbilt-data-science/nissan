"This is the third Equinox that I have leased.  Had a 2015, 2018 and now a 2021.  Great vehicle.  I love it.  Best decision I ever made."
It has everything we need in it it is the largest vehicle I have ever had I usually drive Chevy cars but I am truly enjoy it and it fits all of our needs
This car has all the options we were looking for plus more. It is comfortable and meets all of our needs. It is nice and easy to drive.
"Great SUV with super tech components and seating!  Smooth ride, great pick-up, and a/c are perfect throughout the car!  Our first Equinox was Champagne color. Now we have Pearl Black! So sleeeek!"
"This vehicle has some safety and comfort features that we haven't had before.   At first it seemed like chimes were ""always"" going off.  With some help from Hawkins Chevrolet staff, our salesperson Troy Sunken and another staff person Nick, I have learned to manage the chimes.  The mpg is better than any other Equinox we've had.   Overall, it is a great vehicle.   Our grandchildren said of the back seat, ""It is more comfortable than the previous one.""  So far we are very happy with our purchase."
"This car fits my needs. I find it easy to drive and to park. The sight lines are good. It has good acceleration, and I like the interior design."
This is the 3rd Equinox I have owned and the improvements they keep making are incredible.  I especially have always like the power lift gate. I will be an Equinox customer for as long as they keep making them.
The suv is great. My dog has his spot already picked out. I love the room it has and it drives really nice. I love being able to see the road better
I love everything about my new bowtie and very happy to have gone with a Chevy this time around.  Love the color ice metallic and love the blue jeans inspired interior and love how the body style is derived from the El Camino!
"I have owned this vehicle for less than 2 weeks, so the car and I are still getting acquainted with each other. Although the ride could be more smooth, the car is performing well and I believe it is a good value for the price point. Key features  that appealed to me:  the car is easy to get in & out of plus the gauges & screen graphics are an optimum size for viewing. The car has ample leg room for both the driver and passengers. The Equinox is not too big or too small—just a great Goldilocks size for maneuverability. Happy owner so far!"
"Fun to drive, lots of great features, quiet cabin. Inside isn’t overly fancy, but functional. Turbo boost gives it a little more get up and go compared to other engines this size. Love driving again!"
I absolutely love this car! I have never owned a brand new car and this one fits all my needs. Lots of room to put stuff for my toddler. Drives nicely
This car is very unstable when driving.  I have previously leased a 2018 and a 2019 Equinox and was fairly happy.  The 2021 is a nightmare and the dealership keeps telling me nothing is wrong.
"Looks great, meet all of our needs. Look forward to driving it on trips.  We really like the color and the way it handles on the road."
I love the way you can see everything around him very little blind spots but I’m having a problem with my car engine light is coming on haven’t had it for about three months for some reason or another I’m losing power tried to go up a bridge and I could’ve got out and pushed it up there faster somethings definitely going on I just don’t want to be called I’ve been a lemon now I’m really worried about my car And when you push the gas it just loses power and jerks
"Handles well, comfortable, roomy and easy to drive. Rides high up off the ground, while yet close to the road.  I am not sure about much else."
"Show many new upgrades on the new equinox . It’s a beautiful car it’s so comfortable. It has a phone charging pad, navigation I got the leather package the seats are so comfortable I just really love this SUV."
"This is a great replacement for a van that was now too large. Still able to carry 5 passengers in comfort. The van was good but no longer needed 7 passenger capacity.  Love the new features on the Equinox, still getting used to them. Great vehicle so far."
"Plenty of room, everything easily within reach, lane warning, too close warning, back up camera, strong air movement from the ac, plenty of usable seat adjustments, gas mileage good."
"This the only kind of vehicle I will buy. I have owned many in the past, never had problems. Recommend great family sized suv. Priced just right."
"After owning my Ford Escape for over five years, I was in the market for a new daily driver. My husband had just purchased his first Silverado and we were in love with the Chevy so we went to check out a used 2017 Equinox. I loved it. The change of heart came with the amazing rebates that let me walk away from my Escape free and clear with ZERO negative equity. The Equinox has plenty of room for my quickly growing boy and husband who is over six foot tall. We took it on a trip a week after purchase and it was the best ride I think I've ever taken. I couldn't be happier."
This car met all of my needs... very convenient and comfortable and easy to drive all power...and I got what I want for a car.
We had to take it for service three times. I’m worried it’ll cause us some more problems and will cost us money in the future.
"The Equinox is very comfortable and easy to drive. It has great features for someone that has to travel a lot for work. I am pleasantly surprised, it was not my first choice prior to going to the dealership."
"We bought a 14 Equinox in 2015. Very reliable vehicle, great gas mileage. Lots of room compared to the other crossovers we looked at. We knew what we wanted when we bought the 21 and we were not disappointed."
This car is perfect for my lifestyle. I travel quite often and it is comfortable wi thg h plenty of space for my luggage. It gets great  gas mileage and is always reliable.
"This car is absolutely AMAZING!! I love this car! It’s perfect for me and my kids! I love the smooth ride, I find myself feeling like a celebrity in it! It’s cheap on gas and all the fancy gadgets makes this purchase worth it!"
"Due to services , I had also driven 4 different model of the Equinox. Each of the 4 were a little different, but i liked the size and models."
"This car satisfies my needs.  It has enough bells and whistles to occupy my curiousity.  For a person my size, I find my vehicle very comfortable."
"Car is performing great and getting great gas mileage, happy with our purchase. Has a lot of premium features, dual sunroof, leather seats, and premium paint."
"The car has everything you need.  I am so excellent that I brought this car. Seat are comfortable, rides smooth.  You can talk about this vehicle  all day and night and still couldn't cover had nice it is."
"So far so good.  I’ve really been enjoying driving my new car. I have a lot to learn about it since the technology is newer than I am used to, but it’s very comfortable.  It feels safe and reliable."
"So far we love our new Equinox, not too big, yet very roomy inside.  Many great features including lane change warnings.  The fit and finish is first-rate and the design is user-friendly and intuitive. All controls are within easy reach of the driver.  A good car for a good price."
"Great look, comfortable, easy to operate and very impressed with 4 cylinder turbo. 
I opted for LS with conv. Package and was impressed with features and price!!!"
"Love it so far.  Room, great gas mileage! It is exactly what I was looking for in an SUV without getting into a larger category of vehicle.  Great value for the money!"
"Meets or exceeds all my expectations.  I drive a lot and I need a vehicle I can be comfortable in and that is economical, this meets both requirements."
"I’ve have owned  a Trailblazer, feel this Equinox is a step above. 
Once I get used to all the “bells & whistles” it’ll be perfect."
"We were thinking about buying an Equinox for a while. After test driving it and seeing all  the technology that it has, really an easy decision to purchase a new one. Great looking car with great gas mileage and surprising  acceleration."
This vehicle met all the specific and basic things I was looking for in purchasing a new SUV of any make or model. It was the only dealership in a 50mile radius of me that offered this particular model of an Equinox I was looking for 2021 Chevy Equinox Midnight Edition.
Car was great lots of options that you would find on a car costing a lot more auto dimming head lights speed sensitive cruise control
"This car has a very positive impact on our lives, truly beautiful piece of workmanship by General Motors, comfortable and relaxing to drive; be careful of what you sign up for during your purchase. Because of the Technical gifts in the car and no ability (tech) made the price jump considerably to ensure proper care of vehicle and handling of the tech side."
I previously owned a Traverse and I wanted a slightly smaller car.  The Equinox meets all of my needs.  Extremely quiet vehicle.  I like all of the safety features
Very nice handling and tons of room. Love the color and gets great gas mileage. Has tons of cargo room and was priced very reasonable.
"We are enjoying our new Equinox. Love the styling. The storage compartment in the console is higher than in my last vehicle, so my elbow knocks into it when I use cup holders. This will not be a problem as I get used to it being there."
It is the best vehicle I looked at and I love all its features.  Lots of leg room and cargo space.  It will meet all my future needs.  It is easy to get in and out of and this was a big thing for us as we age.
This SUV has plenty of room for our family of four as well as diaper bags and a stroller.  We are pleased with the price as well as the interior and exterior appearance.  We would recommend this vehicle to family and friends.
"For seen future lemon problems just like the 2010-2013 equinox and chevy will not stand by it Trust me.Have a 17 Arcadia that's heading that way now I own 2 Dodges too those are driven more than the Chevy's, they are trustworthy"
"This car all of my dreams I’ve never owned a brand new car lot of room absolutely love it 
Now I can a comfortable road trip"
Well equipped. Car has a lot of safety and convenience features.  Driving is easy. Quiet and roomy . Good mileage. Pleasure to drive. Fits my needs.
"Between the two of my choice and research; the Equinox was the higher rated in many areas, as well as lower cost.  And the Boucher dealership was friendlier and attentive compared to the other vehicle and dealer."
I wanted a SUV many years ago.... I've looked at other vehicles over the years  but keep coming back to the Equinox!  I love the style and plenty of room for family. It comes standard now with all the newest safety features and is so reliable.  Technology is so easy to adapt to any phone Apple or Android!
This car has all the features I was looking for. Very pleased with the AWD feature.  Like the color too. Handles very good and is comfortable to drive
Love it.   Great on gas and so comfortable.   My son already has one and now my daughter may buy one too.   We havent bought a new car since 2005 so very happythat we chose the Equinox.  Great choice and great value
"My previous car was a Chevy Equinox, never had one problem with it, but it was time for a new one, so I chose to purchase a new one, a lot of nice features and a very beautiful SUV"
This car is stylish and I'm enjoying my comfort in it. Very pleased with my purchase. The alert you get when you get close to the vehicle in front is great.
This car has saved our lives more than once and now I get the newer version. I love it! It is smooth and quiet. The higher trim level (LT) is spacious and I love the chrome accents.
This vehicle is perfect for my husband & me. I am able to get through a lot of snow when we’ve had snow. I have absolutely no problems getting to work everyday. I don’t slide around like I did when I had a front wheel drive vehicle. This is the 3rd Equinox we have driven.
"For the brief time I have owned the 2021 Equinox(3 weeks) it has been good.  Gas mileage in 2wd is good and the battery is somewhat easily accessible.  Oil changes should be relatively simple as filter is easily accessed.  

  The ""advanced safety features"" are annoying more often than not and they will go off simply because a car in the opposite lane passes you.  As a result I have deactivated them all.

  Most can be permanently deactivated but the ""auto start/stop"" requires more effort to permanently deactivate.  Have yet found a way to remove the front camera to disable the most annoying safety features.   

The ""lane keep assist"" can be turned off but must be deactivated every time you start the vehicle, another reason I wish to remove the front camera entirely as I do not desire the subtle steering wheel impulses while driving on snow and ice.   

Overall the vehicle seems to have potential and if its reliability can match that of my 2004 Cavalier I will be very happy but I had the Cavalier for 15 and going so its a high mark I doubt the Equinox will reach."
The car in the highest trim is well appointed with most creature comforts to make the car enjoyable to drive. I purchased it as a daily driver and to be towed by a Motorhomes.
"The color and everything is just beautiful. Don't know why I never wanted a white car before!!!!!  Very smooth styling, makes me happy!  Husband now thinking of getting a match!"
I absolutely love my new vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends and family members. It has a lot of room and is a beautiful color
"Very nice suv with a very comfortable ride. It has a lot of features new to us but we are excited about them. We are also very impressed with the features of the blind spot, lane drifting and the headlights are so bright and automatically dim/bright."
"This car is comfortable, has many luxurious features, and is very easy to drive.  All around, it is pretty much what we were looking for in a vehicle."
This car checks all the boxes for me! I can haul things or just drive in comfort! It is a great car for hauling grandchildren or scrapbooking supplies!
Car is very smooth doesn’t make any noise is the mpg is amazing overall drive super smooth I love that it has Apple CarPlay easy car to get into now with Blindspot good and sensors. I bought the LT trim level
"This vehicle is great, It's not what I wanted to be in but with my situation, was all the dealership could get me. It is a smooth and nice ride and seeing 30 mpg is awesome."
"Great vehicle! Lots of new safety features, great comfort, great performance. If there is any thing with I don,t know what it is. 100 percent satisfied."
This is a good sized car for for seniors like me. It is easy to get in and out of and is easy to drive.
