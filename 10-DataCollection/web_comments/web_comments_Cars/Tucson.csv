"Overall, I am happy with it.  I also have an older Santa Fe, and wanted to try a smaller SUV. I think I would go back to the bigger one on my next purchase. Otherwise, the car has been great for all the other categories. Third Hyundai and it is of good quality like my previous ones."
So far it has been great . It was hard swallowing the price but Iâ€™m hoping it will be my last car.It driver nice and quiet .
"It is exactly what I was looking for. A small SUV to put my dog in & take her to the beach 
4 wheel drive for the snow, reliable"
This vehicle is the perfect blend of comfort and utility. Great value for the price. MPG is very good but not great. Nice infortaintment system.
"Great vehicle. Roomy & comfortable. Drives really well. Definitely one of the most reliable cars I've owned, so I also bought one for my daughter.. I am very happy."
This car is so comfortable. Lots of room. Drives nice. Love everything about it so far. Love the color. Love the heated seats. I recommend this car to anyone
Great ride.  Very smooth and quiet.  We just purchased it yesterday and so far it's great.  Love all the extra features.  The trunk is great.
"Everything about this car I love! EVERYTHING! And the Infinity sound system is an extra bonus! Beautiful car for the money! Like I said, I love everything about it!"
"Bought my new Tucson and within 2 weeks took it on a road trip from Rio Rancho, NM to New Orleans and back. The car performed beautifully under various weather conditions, from hot and dry to cold and hellacious rain. The lane assist is a wonderful thing and who knew a heated steering wheel on a chilly morning would be so nice. It handles very well, accelerates well for merging, and is very comfortable to drive over long distances."
This car was everything I was looking for to last and start me off in life ? It drives great and it has amazing features
This car has met all my needs. It rides very nice and has a lot of features. It has a lot of bells and whistles for the price.
"Impressed with the many safety features that I had never had before buying this car. Itâ€™s a great family car, lots of storage space and roomy seating"
The car offered plenty of Headroom and legroom which is important to me cuz I'm a tall person and get up and go I would recommend the car to anybody
"This is my 2nd tucson 1st on was 2015 limited. Today i just purchased the 2021 ultimate wow everything u can get on a car it has, love the new leather seat very soft different from my 2015, didnt have no issues with my 2015 100,000 miles was still great just wanted a new one .you cant beat this suv for its class an price."
"This vehicle has been subject to a safety recall for 7 months. Dealership says there are no parts to fix it, but I'm ""on the list"".

Car with an acknowledged safety issue that Hyundai will not fix is in my mind unreliable, and a poor value for the money."
This car is amazing !! It has all the latest technology . It drives smooth and helps you drive smooth. It has many safety features and a lot of xtra things you didnâ€™t know you needed .
"After looking at many small suvs, the Tucson was by far the best option for options, looks and value and lets not forget Warrenty. We worked with a great dealership and staff that had a great selection and was very good to deal with which made us happy to believe service will be great also."
"My previous car was a Tucson, and I had it for 7 years. The longest time that I owned a car. Itâ€™s reliable and dependable."
This car has met all my needs. The ride is great and so comfortable.  Beautifully designed.  Love it. I love all the features. The sound system is awesome.
"FANTASTIC Lots of room, even in the back seat. Very stylish. Extremely comfortable for a small SUV. I am very glad we happened into this dealership and met our salesman Brad"
"This is our third Tucson, we love them. It is a great size for our family of four. Some updated features in the 2021 like an updated display and some sensors like like alerts if I drift out of my lane."
"This is what I was looking for. Had everything I needed and wanted.
Beautiful color.  Drives like a car but all wheel drive.  Love it!!"
The car has a recall and the dealer does have the parts to repair. The car uses more gas than my previous Toyota Rav 4 and is less comfortable.
Love my new 2021 Hyundai Tucson. I tried out several other suvs and this one was the best I tried.  I will be taking it on my next vacation and love the smooth ride and comfort. Gets good gas mileage. I have the metallic grey exterior which looks great and has the extra finish. Very roomy cargo space.
Love the many different features one of my favorites is the Bluetooth features also the backup cam drives nice I feel more safe in this car considering my old car needed some work it was paid off didnâ€™t want anymore car payments yet but fell in love with this vehicle
The car is to small very little leg room for tall people and not much space for carrying big items no fogs lights not a family car.
This is the 3rd Tuscan I have purchased.  It is a great SUV for the money and very dependable.  It drives nice and is gas efficient which is important.  I love the look and feel of the vehicle...it looks expensive for a reasonable price.
Love this car for its comfort and security. Itâ€™s been the best  riding experience. I enjoy the quietness of the cabin and the cool features .
Everything is the latest in innovation & technology! Great stereo & all the bells & whistles! Will almost drive for you like a Tesla ðŸ™Œ
"Like that it has all  new safety features. The cabin is very quiet.Lots of connectivity with smart phone and entertainment. Nice interior design, heated seats.Bluelink equipped. Great vehicle for the money!"
"I was looking for an SUV and the Tucson was just what I was looking for! Itâ€™s the perfect size, not too big or small, and has just enough room to meet my needs."
"We have had 3 Rogues, but find this Tucson
has more features than all the others for a
great price.  The longer warranty is also a
nice feature."
This vehicle fits our current needs as we are retired living on a fixed income. Very comfortable and all the excessories we need.nice looking vehicle.
I love this SUV. I  guess it is considered a smaller scale SUV but you would not be able to tell from the inside. There is so much headspace and leg room! I love the way it handles and it is very well made.
"After considering other similar models from other manufacturers and different sizes from Hyundai, we chose the Tucson for value and design features. I really love it so far (only a couple of days). This is my first Hyundai and I am very happy with my purchase including the process with the dealership and the vehicle."
"So far this vehicle has all the features I need, handles well and gives one a good view of the road. Gas mileage is also pretty good,"
Great suv. I have enjoyed driving it so far. Plenty of room. Looks great. Good value for the price. Would recommend to friends and family.
"It is a very nice car for the value!!  Lots of bells and whistles technology wise.   I returned my Grand Cherokee lease and decided to give it a try for the last month.  I purchased the Ultimate trim with AWD.  Itâ€™s a very comfortable car and drives fairly smooth considering the driving conditions Iâ€™ve dealt with the last few weeks(heavy snow/rain).  In the snow, it handled pretty well, I did hear some snow scrape underneath but that was because of the lower clearance.  The handling is pretty good and responds well.   The gas mileage is okay for a 4 cylinder, I avg about 22.5.  The sound system is very nice but I feel that the way the entire radio system/screen works will take some getting used to from my previous car.  When I helped someone move, the cargo capacity with the rear seats folded down was equal to my grand Cherokee as I was able to fit 9 boxes.  The little downfalls with the car arenâ€™t a deal breaker to me but might be important to others.  There are no memory seats.  The 4 cylinder acceleration isnâ€™t impressive but does as it is needed.  And possibly the one thing I do find someone annoying is the key itself.  The buttons are very very sensitive!  Iâ€™ve found myself getting into my car on several occasions with the key in my pocket and I somehow am opening up the tailgate.  Iâ€™ve also once activated panic alarm unknowingly.  This alone in my opinion can be something that maybe Hyundai can modify in the future.  But all in all, for the cost itâ€™s a very good car and I would recommend it.  

Oh, the type of driving I do is commuting to queens from Long Island, as well as commute to NJ."
The new model is very nice. I just wish the automatic trunk option was included with the newer one. I miss having that feature already
"Iâ€™ve only had the car for one week so really canâ€™t give an honest assessment. However, the Hyundai has all the features I was looking to get in a new car."
"So far I have no problems with the vehicle.
I was use to driving a car..So driving a SUV is different.
But it's a different experience for me..
But I'm going to enjoy my SUV.."
"Iâ€™ve wanted the Tucson for quite some time and finally decided to purchase it. I couldnâ€™t be happier! Itâ€™s stylish, roomy, comfortable and drives like a dream."
"Itâ€™s my second time at this dealership and my Second lease with Hyundai.

I couldnâ€™t be happier with my choice. 
4 years ago I was a proudly VW driver and after reading about Hyundai carâ€™s and its amazing reviews I decided to trade in my GLI Jetta for a Tucson AWD.
the car drives nicely, all features and convenience packages were included with the model, which made my decision easier considering everything this car had to offer was a add-on at other brands...
Extremely satisfied with the value for the money. And after 3 years Iâ€™m back at the same dealership to lease another Tucson. Trust me you wonâ€™t regret it."
"This car meets all my needs and beyond . It has plenty of options LCD display Navigation, safety features enough leg room, seats 3 in the back and much more"
"There was no design change for my new Tucson as the 2022 were not in dealers yet. But I didn't have a problem withe the 2018 design, so I got the 2021. Beautiful exterior color red."
This car meets and exceeds all my expectations!  Very Comfy.  I hear it has great leg room in the back (I don't know from experience cause I am the driver!!!!!!)  Getting use to back up camera - and I love it!   Awesome that it pairs with my android - and I can listen to audio books on my drive to town!  Very peppy for a 4 banger.
It is all I need for my family for traveling recreation and pleasure and I enough room for sport fishing and I am hitting the road very soon
"Best suv i have ever owned. Great ride and comfortable. Low maintenance great on gas great performance on the road.will buy a Hyundai again gr
Eat suv"
I test drive 6 different cars from various dealerships and always came back to this one. For the same price it just comes with so many more features
should have upgraded to one with automatic passenger seats.  Only problem. Likes the way it handles on freeway..   Has a comfortable ride. Both my wife and I like driving it.
"I love my Tucson Hyundai so far! It has a lot of great safety features and drives very well. Very spacious and comfortable, I can see myself driving this car for a long time"
I would not buy another   Heater does not wor on feet. When I use window washer I get bad smell. Gas mileage is terrible. That is all.
I like my new tucson overall. Handles great and had plenty of features. It does lack in the fuel economy department though but I am not too concerned.
Very nice SUV that has a lot of comfortable upgrades. Handles well on the freeway and has plenty of safety features. Heated seats are a real plus and I would highly recommend that upgrade.
Love it great car great size  Will be too big for me to drive that is awesome perfect match picked out a blue but as soon as I get changes colors itâ€™s weird but it
"It's well designed and can't beat all the features on it for the price.  It's fun to drive, has good leg room in the back and good storage in cargo space."
Every thing I was looking for and more.  The car rides good and thereâ€™s a lot of room. The car has so many standard features.
This is the perfect upgrade for our granddaughter and her family. Previously owned an Elantra. The Tucson is roomy in front and back and has a roomy cargo bay. The ride is smooth and quiet. This vehicle came with many standard features not found on other vehicles. . Safety is our primary concern and this vehicle meets and exceeds our requirements.
This Tuscon has all the features that I wanted in a car. It was fairly easy learning about all the features that I use. glad I chose it.
This car drives smooth and I feel comfortable and safe while driving it. I donâ€™t have to worry about getting stuck in the snow this winter.
"Nice extra features, drove smoothly, like the lane assist, sound system is great, comfortable seats, love the color of the vehicle, blue link is a nice feature"
I am excited to drive my new car. It has exceeded my expectations. All the new safety features are amazing. I am very pleased with my new Hyundai.
Well made comfortable with that in mind I like the Tucson and and and the deal was one of value. Thank you for helping me with my car selection.
I had a Kia Sorento but decided to downsize.  I still wanted an SUV but wanted something smaller.  I dealt with Kurtland Sliski and he put a great deal together.
"It's been exactly a week since I leased my Hyundai Tucson SE. So far I am loving driving this SUV.  I has almost all of the bells and whistles that I wanted, but it has all the bells and whistles I need. I am looking forward to many great years with this SUV. I'm really happy."
"I Love it, the set's can be Adjust up or down. when you turn on you signal light to get over it let you know if its safe or not"
The backup camera is amazing and large! Makes for parking with ease! The blind spot markers are great and easy to see. I love the blue link which comes in the car where I can start my car with my smartphone from my job without having to go outside into the parking lot.
Very excited with my choice!  Just what I was looking for!  Great teamwork at the dealer Napletons Hyundai. They will make you feel important & walk through all with you.
Love it as a second suv.  It was between this and a car.  It seems to be very comfortable and easy to drive.  We leased it for 3 years.  So far we love it.
I wanted an suv but not a big one this one is a perfect fit. I absolutely love this new car itâ€™s beautiful and exactly what I wanted
This cars was nice and great there a plenty room and nice interior drive very Good  I will advise anybody to go have this amazing experience

"Love this car, tech is great.   It has looks and styling.
I found exactly what I wanted in this car.  I shopped around but didn't find what I was looking for until I saw this car."
Car is. Over my expectations Meet all need very comfortable fit for my family of 3 .gas mileage is wonderful will refer to family and friends
Its the perfect size for me and has all the options i need in a car.  The safety features are great and they're what i looked for in a car
"I purchased the limited. It has great amenities, drives well and is plenty roomy. I like the interior ambience and overall look of vehicle. I am pleased."
"So comfortable, easy to drive, spacious, good in millage, good stereo.
It has the blind spot alert, alert if something is crossing behind you, front seats are heated. Digital AC."
"I love this car. I've only had it for a few days, but this is my 3rd Tucson. I compared this vehicle to the new Forester, but found the Tucson had more for less. Beautiful on the inside and outside."
"Needed to move down in size, we did the research, got plenty of recommendations, and waited for the best deal on a new vehicle in our price range"
Greatly improved vehicle . Better interior and exterior. Good leg room and more safety features. I highly recommend this vehicle. Very comfortable ride and very quiet.
Love the charging station and the panaramic camera. Nice features all around. The color is exactly what I was looking for and the nheated steering wheel is going to be so nice in the winter.
So far the Tucson is terrific .... drives smooth and comfortable .... good on gas mileage and just the perfect size for my wife...Love it!
