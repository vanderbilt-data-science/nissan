I’ve had my 2021 Rogue SL with the premium package for a month now. What a change from previous Nissans!  I love all the technology and convenient features. The 9 inch touch screen is responsive and very easy to see in bright sun. Love the panoramic sunroof and the quality of the interior. The seats are so comfortable. Ride quality is improved. People who complain about a 2.5 with a CVT should not be shopping for 4 cylinder SUV. Who cares how fast it gets to 60 mph?  This SUV in sport mode does just fine when needed. I have to say this has much more responsive acceleration off the line than my Murano had but I get much better fuel economy. I usually drive mine in auto or eco modes to take advantage of the better mpg. I give Nissan huge kudos and was happy to get this 2.5 4 cylinder since 2022s are all 1.5 turbo 3 cylinders.  Yes better gas mileage but the 2.5 is proven and solid.
"I have to preface this by saying I purchased another new car recently and it ended up being a Lemon which the manufacturer repurchased (or is repurchasing because the process drags on forever). That said, I’m a little hyper sensitive to any issues with cars right now. I test drove the Rogue just to “check it out” with no intention on purchasing so quickly after my Lemon experience but I fell in love with it. It’s roomy, has a ton of great features, crystal clear back up/surround camera, awesome moonroof, great MPG’s, etc etc.  Even though the features and look of the car is great, I noticed little glitches from day one. The cameras would switch on randomly when slowing the car during travel, the automatic breaking warning light would come on and then turn off, the radio was working and then sounded like I was in a tunnel and then resumed playing normally, AC blew hot air when on cool until I turned it down to “Lo”, the touch screen acts crazy here and there, etc etc. For the most part I wrote these things off as “user error” or accepting that maybe the car just acted like this. BUT…today after owning the car for about two weeks/600 miles the emergency breaking malfunction light came on and remained on (I’m talking about the big, bright notice that pops up in your dash cluster). Like the other “glitches” the malfunction light disappeared when I parked, turned off the car and then turned it on again. I realized that the glitches might be a little more than what I originally thought though. Having the malfunction light in addition to the warning symbols prompted me to take the car in to service. I’m currently waiting to find out what the issue is and how long it will take to fix. I also did some more review reading and I have to say that I’m really nervous that the car will have continuing issues. The reviews on this site are fairly positive but if you look around a bit more you find some scary stuff about this car. I really thought there was no possible way that I would have this type of experience with TWO brand new cars within a six month period but here we are. I hope this is just some weird full moon voodoo that gets repaired and never causes me an issue again but I’m really not that confident in that right now. All I’m saying is…be careful!"
"Recently traded in my 2016 for the new redesigned 2021 Rogue. The difference is amazing. The build quality has important greatly, styling is upgraded, feels like a much more expensive vehicle. 
Incredible value, very happy with purchase."
Meets our needs comfortable  stylish love the interior and the ride is super cool. We choose black it is beautiful and cool and super nice
Always have been a huge fan of Rogues but I absolutely LOVE this 3rd generation “upgrade”!  Love the exterior and most of all the interior! The ride is smoother and more quiet as well! I’ve had my Rogue for about a week now and have I put about 700 miles on it and so far so good! 100% would recommend as Nissans have never let me down!
Very spacious and economic . Great choice and great color . I was looking for a family car and this car has everything I need it.
My first SUV and I am very happy with it.  The technology is amazing and the car rides so smoothly.  So glad I picked the Rogue
"It's very dependable even in the winter. The back seats are full size to fit adults comfortably. Large screen for GPS or music, Tac & Digital speedometer."
"I have owned/leased Nissans since 1997. I had a 1997,  2001, 2004 and 2013 Pathfinder. I had a 2007 Xterra, 2011 Rogue, 2016 Murano and the 2019 Rogue SL. I have to say that the 2021 Rogue SL, with the premium package is my best leased Nissan yet. Coming from the 2011 & 2019 Rogue, the 2021 is a BIG improvement. The exterior is beautiful and the interior is so luxurious without the luxurious price tag. I did not think I would like the gear shifter, but I love it, especially now that I have more storage space underneath it and the cup holders are up higher. I have loved the zero gravity seats since my 2013 Pathfinder. OMG, they are so comfortable and the back seats are a little bit higher and I love that too. The back doors opening at a 90 degree angle is like the best thing EVER. The ability  to unlock all the doors from all 4 doors is a great feature as well.  I just leased mine on memorial day, and I am 110% in love. They have made the cabin quieter and even though it is just 11hp more, you can definitely feel the difference. It lagged a bit in the 2019, but not this 2021. Huge difference in acceleration alone! Still log my propilot assist, lane change monitoring and so much more. The wireless connection to my iphone is great too. I just love it! 2021 Boulder Gray Pearl Nissan Rogue SL w/premium package :)"
"A nice overall improvement  (gas mileage not included) from my previous 2018 Rogue.  All the ""bells and whistles"" needed to enjoy a comfortable ride from here to there."
As a 51 year old empty nester this vehicle seems to meet all my needs. No longer need a bigger SUV or minivan. Took me a little while to come to that realization but I’m glad I didn’t buy anything larger. Very quiet and comfortable and I get about 33 MPG commuting to the office and back. Family members with CR-Vs and Outbacks are very impressed with this new design. Check it out.
"At first I had no problem with my brand new Rogue, but six weeks after driving the car shut down in my driveway. Information such as “Headlight malfunction, apply parking break. “ remained on the dashboard. The car couldn’t start, had to get a jump. The next morning I took the car to the dealership and after 4.5 hour was told that my ECM was defective and need to be replaced. Don’t they test the cars before selling them. I am so unhappy right now. I feel that this should never have happened. Used car , I understand but brand new car an explanation should be given."
This car is awesome!  I love the ride!! I love the gear shift!  I love the comfort!   Lost some hatch but vehicle is awesome!!! 10 stars!!!
This Rogue met all my needs. It is very comfortable to drive. I like that the rear door opens all the way 90 degrees. It has a great sunroof. Love it
"A beautiful car, but with some annoying problems:
- Shaking / vibrating when driving or accelerating slowly. 
- The hand break stays on regularly when I start driving - for a few seconds, making the engine roar. Won’t get off even if I try to turn it off (and it is supposed to go off automatically).
- Stop hold feature: I love the idea, as I have knee problems and it releases tension in my right knee, but for some reason, when I stay on it for a while (e.g. at the drive thru), it doesn’t come off when I try to drive again. When this happens, I need to stop the car, turn it off, and  turn it back on... Can be dangerous in some situations. Also: the Cruise control with Pro Pilot is a bit scary, as when the car before me changes lane, it starts accelerating way too fast to reach the set speed now that the obstacle is gone. I usually turn it off to control my acceleration on my own. I was driving a 2017 Rogue before, and I felt safer in my old version, by far."
I went with the new Rogue because of its updated  restyling and based upon Nissan’s reputation for  performance and reliability. I am looking forward to a pleasant experience.
"This is by far the most advanced and tech equipped vehicle I've ever owned. Very good , well thought out features and roomier that previous models. Economical so far and very comfortable seating as well as driving. Excellent sound system."
"I purchased this Rouge Platinum for a daily driver with good gas mileage. I am 6' 2""  my 6' wife and our kids are 6' and 5'3"" and we fit comfortably with no complaints. This is our fifth Nissan we currently on a 2019 Armada and I expect the same reliability that we have had with the others.   Coming for a lifted Toyota Tundra I can drive back and forth to work for almost 2 weeks on a site tank of gas as to wear the Tundra went through a tank a week. I can't say enough good things about this SUV."
Crown Nissan is the best dealership and has the best vehicles. Love my new Rogue. All the features and comfort makes driving a pleasure. Easy to drive and rides smooth.
It’s what I was looking for. An AWD that is comfortable and gets great gas mileage. Plus all the other great features the Rogue has.
"It full film my requirements and features that I need to drive safe and comfort , on the road make me happy an like it"
My wife loves her new Rogue. She says it has plenty of power and has a very smooth ride. She especially enjoys the sun roof which is a very nice feature on the car.
This is my second rogue and this year the design has really improved. Quality leather good sound system the back up camera has incredible clarity. I am so impressed with all of the safety features. If I had one complaint it would be that the floor mats are not super durable. I would definitely upgrade or have them throw in an all weather mat. This car is very quiet and handles very well. I love the on the fly traction control for all types of weather. Too many good things to write about!
"Hate the side mirrors, bring back or move them forward.
Bring back the movable rear seat. We used it pushed all the way forward for our dog.
Bring back the rear under floor storage, the same size as the 2018 model."
I have been very impressed with the new Rogue.  I love the new features of this SL model and look forward to many years of problem free driving.  The increased size of the 2021 model provides many Murano like features at a greatly reduced price.
"Had this car 3 months it’s my 3rd Rogue. Monitor not working, no radio, gps iPhone connect charging backup cameras, weird noise, flashing Nissan logo, it’s been 2 months, they cannot find the part anywhere! Nissan consumer affairs have stopped calling to give updates, but yet want you to pay your monthly payment for a new car that’s not 100%
Beware if you buy they cannot fix it, you’ll be stuck with a LEMON!"
Love the improvements made in the 2021 model year. Exterior is sporty and aggressive.  Interior is refined and well appointed.  Great easy to use features
Traded my 2018 for this new design and interior concept. Love it. The 18 inch tires makes a smooth consistent ride. The design in and out is classic gold.
"This car is perfect for me. The doors are tall and easy for me to get in and out of even with arthritis. It has a lot pep. The interior is comfortable. I love the changes on this newer model. Cup holders are more accessible,  the car is a little larger than previous models and the safety features are top notch."
"I bought this car for the safety features. Blind spot warning, forward warning collision, rear emergency braking, rear cross warning, and more,

I really love all these features"
"This car meets all my needs for roominess, easy to navigate. The only thing it's missing is a trunk opener on the fob. If it had that the car would be perfect."
I chose this car because of the headroom when I got in and out of it. Car rides quiet and has all the accessories that I need.
Car has many features that I was looking for.  Comfortable ride and easy to handle.  Controls are easy to reach and understand.  Video provided by Nissan is a great help in understanding the systems.
This Rogue is the best I've owned and I can't wait to start driving it. It has all of the features that I want and need.
I am currently on my second rogue. The first one lasted me 10 years with only normal wear and tear. This second one had me feeling equally as excited when I test drove it. So far it is more than  exceeding my expectations!
This is so roomy and drives so smooth.  I love it.  It is a great color and so easy to drive and learn all the features!!
"Problem with the AC, the temperature cannot be controlled, it comes out hot from the driver's fans and I took it to the dealer and they told me that it was designed to work that way, which is normal, it drives me crazy. I've tried to get the problem solved but until now they say it's normal and bought a dozen new cars and it's the first time this has happened to me with a 42-mile car"
"Rogue with Platinum trim (top of the line) is beautiful inside and out. The backup camera with side and top view is a big help. Plenty of acceleration. Only driven 1,000 mi but fuel mpg is around 31. Disappointed that garage door opener wasn't included. Living in AZ, vented or a/c seats would have been great. Many helpful electronics. I would buy again."
"It dies 3 times on us!  First time after we bought,  15 minutes away from the dealership. They allegedly fixed it.  2nd time, 20 minutes we picked up it died again for the same mechanical electrical issues!! 3 times is a strike!  After pick up again they told me a Nissan engineer worked on the car and it was SAFE to drive!!  It WASN'T!!! It died an hour later in a middle of an intersection where I almost got tbone by a semitruck!!!! Good Samaritans tried to moved the car from the road.  Not even the neutral was working!  It took several strong men to move it out of the intersection and calmed down until my husband arrived!  It was a horrible nightmare!  The dealership didn't take responsibility or ownership of the problem. So now Nissan Corp needs to do it right! We lost of trust!! You put me in danger!"
"THIS TRUCK  TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO. HAVEN'T HAD A NEW ONE IN 14 YEARS,  LOTS OF BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT I WILL LEARN VERY QUICLY WITH MY HANDY MANUAL."
Very dependable and love the leg room and the new wider doors. Overall performance is excellent. Interior design is very colorful and cargo space is what I needed.
This car meets all my needs.  It drives so smooth and has all the items that I wanted.  The new design made me stay with the Rogue.
"This car has lots of space and leg room.
The ride is smooth , quiet and has tons of safety features.
Overall very satisfied of the quality of Nissan Rogue!"
It's enjoyable and fun driving. What can I say but a wise choice and the gas per gallon is a real plus out on the road
"Love this car.  This is my 4th Rogue.  They are reliable and and great car
for the money.   Mileage for an SUV is pretty good."
"I've owned a Rogue before and it was not near as comfortable and sporty as my new one.  Plenty of comfort, and get up and go!  And the gas mileage is much better this time."
So far I love this car! It’s sporty and so nice looking. Fun to drive! Love the huge sunroof. Very comfortable and plenty of power.
"It’s unique appearance, and quiet ride are quite impressive. The driver assist features, and technology, along with the front, rear, and 360 degree camera views are amazing. Did I mention the Apple Car  Play & stereo? Great decision!"
"The 2021 Rogue is very smooth to drive and new features make it an awesome experience. 
The new all-around camera makes parking so easy it’s feel like freedom."
"Before purchasing my 2021 Nissan Rogue SV I was driving a 2013 Toyota RAV4 with all-wheel drive. While the Toyota RAV4 was a good car the 2021 Nissan Rogue is so much better. The car looks good on the inside, looks good on the outside and I have gotten lots of compliments about it. It handles great and the pro pilot assist is awesome to use and the warranty is impressive. I would recommend it to anyone who has not driven this car to test drive one for yourself I believe you will be impressed to the point of buying one if you're in the market for a new car."
"Can’t speak to reliability since I just bought mine.  It’s an SL AWD in Boulder gray.  I absolutely love it, maybe more than any car I’ve ever owned - and I’ve owned a lot of cars.  Styling is superb, comfortable, electronics seem great!  Love the lane departure warning/ assist.  The interior trim really looks like a lot more expensive car.  I’m male and I like that the new rogue looks a lot more aggressive, especially from the front.  Only option I generally get that this car lacked is nav, which I never used anyway.  I had not seen one of the 21 models until two days ago, really stopped me in my tracks.  Last thing I must say: when I shut my door, it doesn’t take a lot of effort and the door sounds a bit like a safe shutting.  Solid."
"This car does everything well. It’s very comfortable and good on gas my only complaint is it lacks power. The seats are very comfortable, it’s very good on gas and the safety features are awesome"
"The exterior is aggressive looking and modern.  The interior is full of high end tech, quality finishing and comfortable.  It's my wife's car, I am 6 foot and 350 pounds who loves his room and V6 engine.  This car has ample room for me and believe it or not, I am impressed with the efficiency of it's 182 hp v-4"
"This is my 3rd Rogue! I absolutely love the Nissan Rogue! The 2021 design is awesome! Love it, love it, love it! Thank you Drivers Village Nissan/Heather C."
"I love this vehicle. Handles easily. The front screen is great dont have to put my phone up anymore 
Apps viewable on screen.
Great space for kids and their luggage."
"We sought after the champagne color and finally found one, It is a show stopper, we are previous Rogue owners and just love everything about it."
"Inside and outside it is great. Inside a lot of space. Feels more luxurious than sport, nice features on the SV version, similar and some additional to the Rav-4 and some like the speed change behind the wheel as the lexus NX-300.
The autopilot that stays in the lane and adjust the speed to a slower front car. You only have to stay awake."
"New design is classic and functional. All safety features I was looking for were standard and the 21 Rogue is comfortable and economical. The inside is roomy,  thoughtfully designed, and fun to drive. The safety features are impressive."
I love the exterior of the car and the wheels are really awesome too!! The interior is very comfortable and the back seat seems very roomy too!! Can’t wait to know my car more !!!
"Beautiful, roomy vehicle! Big vehicle, for  little money. This SUV has class written all over it! Extensive look of class and sleekness.  It holds stunning decor beautifully."
This car is very spacious and comfortable. I love how they design the interior. My favorite part is the panoramic moonroof. It has met all my expectations.
"The car is quieter and smoother riding than the 2018 Rogue I turned in. I love the features, although I'm still learning to use them."
My wife owned a 2019 Nissan Rogue and I fell in love with the new design. It is an amazing improvement over an already great car!
"I totally love my new car! They redesigned the 2021 Nissan Rogue, and it has all the features I was looking for in my new car."
"We just leased our 4th Rogue - love it!! Comfortable, great on gas, easy to drive. Would def recommend! Not once have we had any weather related issues with this truck. The 2021 is so much fun to drive"
Transmission CVT not good  most Nissan car now have Cvt not reliable. Very expensive to fixed .Same problem and Nissan don’t do anything about CVT .
The car is completely comfortable and drives very well and it is easy to use and the dealership was very helpful and very easy to work with
Awesome Best suv i ever drove from day one drove quite an amount of miles  that day to ride Very comfortable and an awesome ride
"The 2021 Rogue technology is outstanding! The Navigation Screen is superb and the craftsmanship blew me away! I was going to purchase a 2020, but opted in for the 2021...Glad I did...it will be delivered to my home in a few days! I remain a Rogue fan as it just gets better and better."
It's styling is average since all new vehicles this style basically look the same. It's comfortable and rides decent.. better than previous years. The shifter design is a ridiculous setup and unnecessary. The stereo screen design is just plain ugly and stupid. Totally ruins the interior look. Constantly wiping off finger prints. Sunlight makes it impossible to see. The vehicle is LOADED with a confusing menu. The Bluetooth doesn't shut up. It just keeps going on and on with jibberish when trying to make a call. Totally unnecessary. The upholstery design is decent with 2 tone style but the ugly cheap and horrid line pattern on the seats and doors is a down right afterthought. Also a laundry list of electrical and computer issues. The engine runs loud and sounds like an older diesel truck Don't be fooled by the new commercial on tv.. this vehicle has a long way to go to be average.
"This car is smooth, comfortable, great 360* cameras. I love it. The two tone color looks sleek. The heated seats and steering wheel are so nice."
I am completely in love with my Platinum Trim Nissan Rogue. It has all the bells and whistles in it and I couldn’t be happier! The Boulder Gray Pearl/ Black color is beautiful! I would recommend this car to anyone! Sooo happy with my car choice and purchase!
Great technology in features provided. Styling is impressive. Car looks great both inside and outside. Pricing was very competitive when compared to other car brands with vehicles in this class.
Review is for 2021 Rogue SL AWD with the Premium package. Looks - get the 2 tone it's so good looking and the body style redesign is fantastic. Bose audio is outstanding (only available with Premium or Platinum). Lots of tech... Be prepared that this vehicle is DIFFERENT. Driving is with a knob and more buttons and switches. This is my 3rd Rogue and I love them but you need to test drive it first to make sure you are okay with the new way to drive it! Cargo area is smaller than my 2018 but I'm okay with that... Lots of room if you fold down the back seats which is easier now. Divider between driver and passenger takes getting used to... Not sure if that's an improvement because the open space under the center divider could be easy to get your hand stuck in. The button placements are much better now but the start button doesn't illuminate so make sure you set your interior lights properly so you can see the button. Overall I'm really loving it but it might not be roomy enough for every driver.
My new one has leather which allows me ease of getting in & out as I have a bad knee. It has so many safety features. Very very comfortable seats.
"Beautifully redesigned,  very quiet and smooth ride.  Love the safety features,  great gas mileage.  The technology can be a bit intimidating at first but definitely worth the effort to adjst."
"It is very comfortable. Love the heated seats and steering wheel. Very quiet inside. I’m most impressed by the safety features of the vehicle. Bird’s eye view cameras, blind spot notification, as well as assistance if swerving into another lane. Very excited about this vehicle."
Just love driving this vehicle! It's so comfortable and easy to drive. Has all the bells and whistles I wanted in a car in Northeast Wisconsin - can't beat the heated seats and steering wheel!
"This car meets all my needs. Has a good price, reliable, propilot assist, cameras, SOS. NissanCOnnect, Sunroof... many more feature for the MSRP. Will highly recommend this car."
"This car exceeds our expectations and is a great experience to drive, the comfort is beyond words to explain. Sales person is a plus for your company."
"Very well designed, with plenty of features included in a base price. Excellent value for the money. Performance is outstanding, comfortable, and quiet. The luxury feels and look for the competitive price."
Some of the great features are more room for passengers plenty of storage. Easy drive overall comfortable.great color. Backup screen is very clear.If you have a chance to visit this your Nissan dearship test drive this car.
Excellent car fully loaded good on gas it has remote starter heated seats sunroof nice rims my phone was very easy to connect all leather interior.
This is my first car but I am so glad I got this one. It’s very nice and feels extremely luxurious. All the technology is easy to use and makes the car all that much better.
"Yesterday (11/29/2020) my sister bought a brand-new 2021 Nissan Rogue. She was upgrading from an old Toyota Highlander and wanted a more fuel efficient SUV, and fell in love with the 2021 Rogue's styling. When she bought it she was impressed! I was told that Nissans last forever and I can agree as my dad owns a 2010 Frontier with 180,000 miles (11/2020) that still runs like it's 2010. We love Nissans! (Also, if you're going to write a review on a car on this site, please don't talk about the dealer, there is another section on this site that allows you to review dealers.)"
"It’s early in my purchase, however I feel that I’m going to enjoy it.  It definitely has a lot of new features that I’m going to have to get familiar with."
"I test drove the Rav4, CR-V, and the Rogue.  The Rogue blew away the competition so we bought it!  It's got the best seats, best interior, and quietest ride of the three.  Nissan really knocked this one out of the park."
This car seems to have more room up front.   Very comfortable.  I like that the display screen is larger. The back up camera is clearer and easier to see
"It has plenty of leg room specially for the person sitting behind me, the interior look luxurious, plus it come with a bunch of nice gimmicks you guys need to go and see this car me telling about it doesn't do it justice"
