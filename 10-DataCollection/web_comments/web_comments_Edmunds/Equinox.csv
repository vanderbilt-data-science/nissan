Equinox,3 out of 5 stars,I bought a 2021 Chevy Equinox LT and after bringing it home and driving at a higher speed than the test drive I noticed an annoying  wind noise coming from the driver and passenger side. I thought the windows were not rolled up all the way and hit the button and windows were up as far as they would go. Noise still there. Took it back to the dealer and they checked door alignment and adjusted it as per specs. Noise is still there. They said it was coming from the rearview mirrors and nothing they could do about that. Is anyone else having this problem and what can be done about it.
Equinox,4 out of 5 stars,"bought a 2021 Equinox and I must say I am impressed. I thought a 4 cylinder turbo would lack the power BUT I WAS WRONG. Bought the LS with cov. package and it is JUST what we need in a vehicle. LOTS of room, great appearance, handles like a sports car at a price that IMPRESSED me!."
Equinox,3 out of 5 stars,Car handled well looked nice engine had pep brakes were good But I did not buy this car because the drivers seat was pure misery it was so uncomfortable that after 10 minutes I ended up with a back ache ...Number one thing in a car for comfort is the seat this seat was narrow and hard and cheap Im 6'3 inches 180 pounds tall and thin no one could be much thinner than me could not find any comfort no matter how I adjusted the power seat I love the car would have payed CASH for it on the spot but the cheep miserable drivers seat put a wrench in the sale I dont know how people wider than me can even drive this car
Equinox,4 out of 5 stars,My barely 3000k miles 2021 equinox is already misfiring when first start. Also it shakes from the back suspension after 75 mph. This is sad considering is a brand new car. Besides that it offers decent amount of tech for the price. Lucky for me this is only a lease. I won’t finance this.
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,"Size ,ride,accesories are all perfect for my needs- luvin my Equinox"
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,the 2021 equinox LT has lots of nice features and convenient also its comfortable sets and rides smooth and has very good power and SUV is very stylish too
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,I rented a 2021 Equinox for a week.  Was pleasantly surprized it did everything well. The 4 cyl engine had me fooled it was a V6 until I opened the hood - its got V6 levels of quietness & smoothness.  The ride was as smooth & quiet as a Malibu or Camry - much smoother & quieter than several Toyota Rav4's I have rented.  The transmission was silky smooth (unlike the jerky Rav4). The vehicle tracked straight on the highway.  The AC was cold.  Cannot think of any faults other than the seat bottom could use more padding and the fuel economy is 4 MPG worse than the Rav4
Equinox,4 out of 5 stars,"The car does not feel as roomy as the older models but not uncomfortable.
 The ride is fine.  The car needs a redesign to give it a more pleasing look.  It looks like you are driving a cheaper car.  I wish I had purchased the Premier. It is a little difficult to enter and/or exit for a senior."
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,Great SUV. not too small and not too big.
Equinox,1 out of 5 stars,"The engine runs rough on start up like it has a missfire or vacuum leak. The transmission doesn’t shift correctly.  The dealer says nothing is wrong. It drives like all the other cars they have. Now the car shakes like it has loose wheels.  I don’t know if the axles aren’t spinning at the same speed. I don’t want to take it in again for this new problem, because they don’t fix anything.  Just another day wasted at the garage and more of my valuable time I can’t get back.  I bought a new car so I wouldn’t be at the garage."
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,Great car comfortable and inexpensive has everything you need a new more.  Cajun Red is beautiful.  Gas mileage is superb.  Can’t miss on the Equinox Premiere with AWD
Equinox,3 out of 5 stars,I’m writhing this review hoping someone with the same issue isn’t stressing/ struggling like me . My brand new equinox with under 900 miles on it will  randomly wobbling / shake  in the front end while driving ! After a few seconds  it goes back to being a prefect normal smooth ride . The Dealership and GM have no idea what’s going on with it and are finally trying to diagnose it again ! I really wanted to love this car but I feel like it’s a major safety issue .
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,"Had a 2015 and now my 2021, love the performance of the Equinox and the looks of it, I have plenty of room"
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,It drives like a Cadalac... super happy
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,"I'm impressed with the Great Options that comes with my new SUV. Heated seats for winter on my breaks and lunch, auto dim headlightsgreat for traveling on back roads, stability on curves and hills, Crash alarts when vehicles in blind spots and stay on the road to avoid a ditch. I switched from a mini van to The Equinox great choice."
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this vehicle this past spring. Has been 25 years since our last NEW car, (still have the '96 Blazer) All the upgrades, safety features, and all the modern electronic features took us some time to figure out but we're getting there. The power of the turbo 4 cyl.really knocked me off my feet, it takes off like a 747. So far, love the car."
Equinox,4 out of 5 stars,"I like my Equinox but do miss some of the accessories my Cadillac SRX had, like heated steering wheel and a CD player."
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,Great color selections!!
Equinox,5 out of 5 stars,"Wondering what is causing diamond shaped patterns on my windows , it showed up out of no where . Read my manual cover yo cover . Wondering"
Equinox,2 out of 5 stars,"Every 2 years the equinox is exchanged for a new one since it is a company car. 2021 has the most brutally uncountable seats, forcing your back to arch and presses your shoulders forward. Additionally the traction control on the base model is worse than any car I have been in within the last 10 years, other people have had similar experiences and have worn through 60,000 mile premium tires in less than 15,000 miles (believed to be from changing power from tire to tire) this used to be a great vehicle and Chevy has really messed it up, please fix this vehicle."
Equinox,4 out of 5 stars,The overall ride and handling is very nice
Equinox,2 out of 5 stars,"Car looks great, great controls, great standard features.  Can't say enough good about the vehicle.  Until you sit in and drive it.  All the good things about this car goes out the windows when you sit in the drivers seat and ride in it.  I physically am in pain after driving it.  I don't know what it is about the front seats they are incredibly unfordable.  I don't know how the designers of this vehicle missed something so PAINFULLY obvious.  If you like in northern climates I would recommend getting a AWD version.  As nimble as it is on dry and wet pavement it gets really squirrely when there is snow on the road."
