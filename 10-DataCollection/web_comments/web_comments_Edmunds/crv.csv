crv,5 out of 5 stars,"This is my second CR-V (still have my 07 which is still going strong with  175k miles:)
I love everything about the 2021. Drives like a bigger car in a good way, substantial and safe. The interior is lovely. Luxury feel without Luxury price.
Also, regarding all the reviews that complain about confusing infotainment system, if I can figure it out (without the manual) ANYONE can.
Love my Sonic Gray Pearl CR-V"
crv,4 out of 5 stars,"Awesome space. Brought the car for the spacious cargo and got it around for 28325 for EX trim. Guys, nowadays dealers are giving a good price. Please check with another dealer to get the price. Initially, I was hesitant to get this car. Now I am happy with the price they offered. Drove 3000 miles and super cool"
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"Ive had this car for 3 mths. bought brand new. Drives great, but the paint is terrible. Thin and soft. So far Ive had like 5 rock chips and there are some scratches from the unknown. I did not get paint protection on this car because other cars Ive had in thr past never needed such thing. Cars made today should be painted better."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Boy, do I love this car. It feels like it sometimes is driving itself with the lane assist. I love the seat warmers. I love the sound system. I love that I can take a turn and it grips the road. I love that it is so smooth driving and going over bumps. I love that I can put my GPS from my phone on it's more than ample big screen. Did I say-... I LOVE MY HONDA CRV!!"
crv,4 out of 5 stars,"Chose this car over similar ones in this class as drove the nicest.  Is quiet, adequate power, 
The bad, headlights not so bright, seat feels like a park bench."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a new 2021 CRV in August.  We have only put about 3,000 miles on it and went to start it the other day and it wouldn't start.  The whole dash started flashing with all kinds of failures.  We checked the battery, fully charged.  Had to call for a tow.  The Honda dealership couldn't start it either.  The codes were U0100 F-can malfunction and U0038 IMA Can Malfunction.  They don't know why and said it's an intermittent issue that could happen again.  My Honda warranty does nothing for me since they couldn't locate exactly what was causing the two codes to appear.  They wiggled wires, cleared the codes and did a battery reset but found nothing else wrong. I specifically bought a Honda because of I thought they were supposed to be high quality and a car I could rely on.  Now I'm scared to drive it as who knows when the intermittent issue will happen again. Is it going to fail while I'm driving?  I've lost all trust in my brand new car and prefer to drive my 14 year old Toyota instead.  $33k for a lemon, buyer beware."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,The CRV EX-L has great pickup and an amazingly comfortable ride. It’s very spacious and you can’t beat the mpg.
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"I totally hate the auto start/ stop feature. You should be able to disable it from the ""SETUP"" program and/or adjust the delay for the engine shut down. Main reason I hate it is that it is my wife's car and is typically driven on very short trips around town. Typically she goes thru 6 start cycles in under 5 miles., 3-4 times a week. The battery never recovers above 12.25 volts .  .  .  which is a 70% charge state. YES . .I know there is a disable button you can push every time you start out. BUT . . .it is very poor engineering to have to do that. I am looking at a battery maintainer to save having to replace a $200. battery in the near future."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,743 miles on it . Merge on interstate and lose power and dash goes crazy with system failure messages . Talk about fearing getting killed before can get off road!!
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"We just got the 2021 CRV Touring on a beautiful Sonic Gray color. We've had CRVs since 2002 and this latest model has a great feel on the road, no road noise which used to be an issue and the Touring comes with all the bells and whistles. Also the cargo space still is excellent, the turbo renting is very responsive, we will see how fuel efficient is but we expect it will be very good."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"I test drove several similar classed SUV's.  I have had two Kia Soul's so good comfort and great audio were creature comforts I would not go without.  I wanted something bigger, safer, and AWD.  

The CR-V EX trim for me give me the seating comfort, great audio, safety features, AWD, and fuel economy I was looking for.  I shopped, I test drove everything in the same class.  Check the warranty offerings and options (I got some awesome rubber all weather CR-V floor matts that are much better than the plastic Weather Tech's I bought for my Kia) - there were other options I didn't even know about before I sat down to buy the car so I passed because I hadn't planned for them.

Solid smooth ride with none of the noise or underpowered engines on some of the other makes.  Plan on keeping this one for a long time."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,Purchased 28 days ago and AC has already gone out. Of course dealer can’t get part and it will be two weeks to get it fixed. Trading it in as soon as I can. Infotainment glitches already as well. Very disappointing.
crv,4 out of 5 stars,Purchased new and really could be better. Infotainment is awful and slow. Really not happy with this in this day and age. Hondalink is really useless in this vehicle and can't do nothing with this app. Can't even start car with app--come on honda! Engine has been fine and get great gas mileage and performance. I guess Honda thinks it will be fine without modern refinements. This just might be my last honda if electronics are not upgraded.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,I have had my CRV for a little over two weeks and love the gas mileage and ample room.  It is fun to drive and the love the extra safety features.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Honda CR-V is a comfortable solid car that drives great. I would recommend the CR-V to anyone looking to buy a good reliable family car.
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"This is the third CRV I have owned.  I traded my 2013 for a 2021, after almost 170k in trouble-free miles.  I wish it wrere possible to get have gotten a brand new version of the 2013 rather than this overcomputerized, over plasticized car.  Too much plastic.  While handwashing, I could not put too much pressure on plastic bumpers, worried loosen them up, further.  Build quality not nearly as solid as the earlier model.  Despite all that, hoping for same reliability, at least mechanically."
crv,2 out of 5 stars,The engine is roo noisy. It sounds like driving 10year old car every time you press gas. Not many people mention this. Very disappointed. Over rated for sure.
crv,2 out of 5 stars,"Title says it all. I purchase the vehicle brand new (2021) three weeks ago, and have had it towed once and serviced twice. First the battery was already dead, then the infotainment system would no longer work. It’s okay looking, smells nice, and handles decently but I can already tell this was a poor purchase. Buy something else."
crv,4 out of 5 stars,"Well we just ordered our 2nd Honda CR-V touring.  Both my wife and I have so much good to say about this suv!  We took advantage of high used car pricing and ordered another new 1      Trust me on this , the Crv is 1 of the very best    Handles great , very comfortable , looks awesom for a suv !   And was trouble free.   I. Hope the next 1 is the same.  New 1 will be black pearl on black should be awesom.    John"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Great comfortable car. Has all the bells and whistles. Great gas mileage. I certainly hope the electronics survive. I hope Honda has fixed the oil dilution issue.
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"The CRV feels like a small car, not an SUV. The engine is loud and the transmission is pretty rough when you are stepping on the peddle and accelerating quickly. We.were very surprised how poorly this car handles in the snow. The biggest issues we have had are with the interior and the overall technology. First this vehicle is not able to utilize the Honda app for remote start, or to lock the vehicle. The Honda app is actually a pay subscription service. The screen and controls also look grainy and like they have not been updated in many years. The screen feels and looks antiquated. The number one issue is the incredibly intrusive dashboard that comes to a point between the front seats. Storage is not convenient and the front seat is not comfortable for tall riders. Overall the CR-V is just OK. It looks good from the outside, but it really feels like it needs some updates on the interior and technology. It is a great vehicle for your grandmother."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Honda CRV AWD upgraded trim 7 months ago and have 2300 miles on it.
I've brought this car to two dealerships for help. I hate my CRV because of the way it shifts from braking to gas. When I take my foot off the brake as in at a stoplight, it makes a heavy clunking shift feel and sometimes lurches. To drive the car, one should feel nothing between the shifting of brake to gas pedal. The dealerships say it's a normal feel because of the auto engine idle. I think is either a flaw of the car, or I've got a lemon. I wanted this roomy vehicle to carry bikes and passengers. Also, the heated leather seats barely heat up. The service department head at one dealership said that it's normal for the bottom part of the seat to be cooler than the back."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"5,000 miles in and I HATE this car.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  It is underpowered, uncomfortable, gets poor MPG (I drive all highway miles and am averaging 26 MPG) for the size and performance, the heat is non-existent, it has a lot of road noise, the outdated infotainment system is very clunky and often doesn't work, the AWD is not as good as other systems out there, the center console/storage leaves much to be desired.  Worst of all, I went to start it this morning and nothing.  The car is 2 months old and left me stranded.  My wife drives a 2015 Pilot and we love that car.  This is a total disappointment.  I would not recommend this car to anyone.  Get a Toyota or a Subaru and be happy.  This is last Honda I will ever own.  If I could convince the dealer to take this back, I would get rid of it in a heat beat.  Shame on you Honda."
crv,2 out of 5 stars,The XM/FM/AM radio tuning is terrible.  You have to Search  ...  the tuning knob I had on my 2018 Accord was great ... this 2021 CR-V.  Tailgate latch in intermittent ... alarms when exiting the car when nothing is wrong.  Never again... I'm going  to something else next time
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Fast and zippy plus luxurious comfort of a ride!
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Car has automatic headlights and automatic high beams, I work at night lights up the road great. High beams go on and off at the right time.  The big taillights are important since a lot of people cannot see at night as you pass them by. Only $30 to fill up compare to $40 for my other SUV. Plenty of power at 40 mph before you know it.  I had a 2000 CRV lasted 19 years.  Just lost my 2009 in last hurricane. Got a sonic grey pearl CRV EX everything great so far."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"There is a national car shortage of new cars and most dealers will laugh when presented with advertised lease specials.  We had a 2009 Honda Accord EX-L which had been mostly rock solid and had 129,000 miles, mostly trouble free.  One Saturday I took it in for a scheduled oil change.  The dealer is literally within eyesight of my house.  While there I strolled around and was shocked to see only one new vehicle in the showroom. The front lot was full of used cars for the most part.  I then observed a 2021 CRV EX-L AWD in Sonic Pearl Gray.  The dealer had 2 grand of add ons plastered on.  I started talking to a salesman and the story was a lady had ordered it and didn't like the color upon seeing it on the lot.  It had 10 miles on it and it was the only CRV they had. On impulse alone  I told the salesman to write up a lease based on their loaded sticker.  So I paid a few bucks over list and I don't care.  It's the way things are at the moment. Two days later I sold the 2099 Accord to the first person who came to look at it.   The CRV is a good, solid reliable vehicle with many good features.  And decent gas mileage.  I also have another vehicle with a 250 HP V8 and I like the acceleration of the CRV.  It isn't a Lexus nor is it meant to be. The leather interior is comfortable,  passable  and fine for everyday use.  There is plenty of room in the rear for storage.  I like the power rear gate.  The turbo engine is more than adequate.  The stop/go feature is annoying but easily disabled.  We plan on keeping Sirius.  The sound system is above average.    In short, it's the first new car I have  bought in over 50 years and I'm impressed with the fit and finish.  It's quiet enough for me and both my wife and I enjoy driving it.  Love the memory seat function although I also have it on the other car this one is more accurate.  We leased it for 3 years and at that point we will decide to buy or lease again.   In the meantime I am looking for a dealer who will give me a Pilot for the advertised lease price from corporate Honda.  Maybe in a couple of months.  For now, we have the CRV and we're satisfied.   

Update. April 2022. After 6 months we have put 4,000 miles on the vehicle.  The memory seats are very handy  Mileage for our shorts trips is about 18 MPG   The occasional highwayvtrip is in excess of 30.  It's a smooth car we like it.  So far, so good."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"Just after 60 miles, yes a new 2021 cr v with leather, waiting at a light all the warning indicators came on . The engine didn’t  totally shutoff. I was only able to drive only 10 miles an hour looking at the dash flashing every code in the vehicle. Was instructed by the service manager to try to drive it into the dealership, which I did. Took me over an hour to go a few miles. After an hour was told the composed to be relearned? REALLY?
I can t tell you how angry I was. At this point
I can t trust the car. With COVID still around I don t need my wife and grandchildren to be stranded. Right now I m stuck with a vehicle I no longer want. I changed from Toyota to Honda hoping to get a better vehicle. Boy did I make a mistake. I don t know what to wish for more problems so I can claim a lemon law vehicle or just hope for best.
I guess I have to hope this was a one off problem and a reboot was all that was needed, but trying to get my wife back in the car will be a challenge."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"This is our sixth new Honda, covering the last 40 years.  All of these vehicles have been very dependable, low maintenance, fine driving, and extremely safe vehicles.  The new CRV is a fine addition to Honda's history of fine vehicles.  I feel for those who have had a bad experience, but with Honda it's normally the exception rather than the rule."
crv,4 out of 5 stars,"I needed a gas sipper to put a lot of miles on. I had grown accustomed to driving my spouse's bmw and didn't realize how very weak the engine in this car is. It has no power. Other than that, it is well appointed. The style is modern and the cabin is roomy and comfortable. The four stars is for overall, but the engine gets one star."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"I got my crv in April. I have 6k miles on it, just got an oil change only 2 weeks ago. The check engine oil message is already on. I tried resetting inside the setting but it still occurs every 10 secs while driving. So annoying. I though Honda was supposed to be reliable. Oil issues with the 1.5T, think before buying or leasing this thing. I can’t wait to trade in with something else"
crv,2 out of 5 stars,"Travel to Outer Banks NC in July 2021, first long trip using the navigation. For starters it is not a user friendly app. The navigation only routes one way. Only changes can be made while car is stopped and in park, in slow moving traffic on I-95 it presents a problem, system selects reroute but does not show the route. Finally just turned off navigation and used my I Phone, much better than the useless Navigation in Touring model. Honda selling the CRV Touring as the best, but has the public fooled. The Honda engineers should drive using this navigation system in real world traffic. Avoid the Touring models as this is not worth the extra $$. The EX-L is far superior to the Touring. I know in the future that I will have no vehicle with Navigation."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Wow!  The features in this SUV are sustainable. Automatic high beams, Apple CarPlay, reverse camera, sun roof, the list just goes on an on. It’s a great ride and I would tell anyone looking for a SUV this have a lot of value for the price!"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"We drove comparable models from Subaru, Toyota, and Mazda.  The Honda CR-V wins hands down as far as price, amenities, comfort, quietness inside, cargo space, pickup. responsiveness and handling.  Nothing comes close at this price point."
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"We bought the LX because we eventually it will be inherited by my 12 yr old son when he goes to college.  The 2021 LX model has bad ergonomics compared to base models of Civic and Accord.  The LCD screen is very small, you will have to squint to look closely because the quality is also poor.  I hope there is an aftermarket upgrade for this.  No audio jack?  Cmon.  At least provide 2 USB if you cant provide an audio jack like what they have on the base Civic and Accord.  No power source for the rear passenger.  How much would that be for an LX.  Lastly, the auto idle stop and hand breaks are the most annoying features.  Both are confusing.  The hand break is electronic which is a user experience downgrade compared to the normal push with your feet.  The auto idle stop is the most irritating feature I have ever seen.  The default is always activated.  There is no way around it.  We hesitated on an EX.  For the money spent on an EX, better spend it on a V6 Passport or Pilot."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"I truly love this car. It has so many updated new accessories and technology. It has the wheel assist along with sensors when switching lanes, sunroof, Apple CarPlay, heated seats. When getting too close to a car it will start breaking on its own. If you don’t drive between the lines and slowly swerve it takes control of the wheel and merges you back into the lane. It also has push to start and a remote start. Not to mention it’s amazing on guess and very reliable. You can’t go wrong with this car."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"They do not discount theses vehicles much below MSRP.  But, still a great value.  Great ride, great handling and great gas mileage, around 34 mpg."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"When my BMW X3 lease was up, I needed the affordability of the CR-V.  I went with the EX-L so I could enjoy some of the same amenities I was accustomed to in my X3. I love the leather seats and warmers.  The sunroof is a plus.  I’m very impressed with the size. The CR-V has much more legroom in the back seat. It’s easy for little ones to climb into. The rear cargo area fit all of our luggage for a family of 4 road trip. Eventually we may need something bigger, but this is suitable for now.  I love the gas mileage and efficiency. The adaptive cruise and lane keep assist are new to me, and I love these features on a long road trip. The infotainment system has given me no trouble and Apple Car Play is great to have. I love the extra USB ports. They definitely come in handy for charging multiple devices. 

I’ve driven literally every car in this class, and the CR-V has been my favorite by far. Though it can’t compete with the performance and experience of the X3, it has some punch - more than expected. Overall this is a great car for getting the job done safely and affordably!"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Make sure you visit many dealers as the price varies considerably!
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Honda CR-V is a great, reliable car. It drives well & has great gas mileage which I like a lot.  I like the touring, as it has a larger navigation screen as well as other nice features."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Awesome car!  I did have to buy a seatbelt extended for the back seats because they are backwards and also don’t extend.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Love this car! I loved my Accord but wanted an SUV type vehicle. This vehicle has lots of great features, gets good gas mileage, is roomier than my Accord and the price is right!"
crv,3 out of 5 stars,I've owned 6 crvs. I usually trade every 4 years. From the first to the fifth I just had to learn the new changes which were always for the better. My 2020 touring model is my least favorite. The engine is noisy and I don't care for the dying engine T stop lights.  One more thing to go wrong and has to be shut off with every start. Don't care for humps over the front wheels which is a little distracting when parking. But what I miss beyond words is Lane watch which is the right side camera. Can't believe it isn't even an option. The flashing symbol on the mirror is a joke. Totally useless. I wanted a certain color so trusted the salesman and bought before delivery because I've had 5 other crvs. Big mistake.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Great ride with all the bells and whistles. Our choice because Honda is known for their reliability. Smooth and comfortable ride and we were able to get the color and all the extras we were looking for.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,A lot roomier inside than I thought.  Very quite smooth ride. Stereo is awesome. All computerization inside very easy to learn. Love my features that come with this model.
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"We bought a Honda for the confidence in engine and overall reliability, and CRV for cargo space. I expect those to deliver over time. However, other manufacturers quality ratings have become very similar. The fit and finish of the CRV are frankly not impressive - I’m noticing more light plastic as time goes on, and the value vs what we paid for vehicle and accessories is lower than we have gotten from Honda previously."
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"I sold my Honda Civic and bought a CR V a few months ago. I have 20,000 miles on my car already and I have driven most of them in the highway.
A noticed that the car shakes when driving on the highway. A few weeks ago, I was on the highway and opened my back windows; the car was shaking, my doors shook so hard, I thought they were going to fly away. I thought something fell off and my car was going to break. A few moments after panicking, I thought to put the windows up and that was that. It was scary, and now I drive more aware and I am thinking that this car is too light. 
When driving it in the highway, it shakes like going through a hurricane. (I know about this, I live in Florida.) 
I am really disappointed and I sent an email to Honda and just a case number but nothing else. I am thinking in selling it and changing brands."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,This a a great and comfortable car. It is also a very safe car. It has a very advanced techbology.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"12 way power heated driver seat is the most comfortable! Perfect size vehicle, love all the options! Great color and love the rims! I am very pleased and happy I purchased my 2021 Honda CR-V from Honda of Ocala! Great Teamwork!"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Just over 800 miles. We love it. Traded in a jeep renegade. After 2 years driving the jeep this car is like a luxury vehicle. It's quiet, comfortable, and better gas mileage. We are very happy with our choice. Can't say enough about this car. Great car, good price. Was a bit concerned with the small 1.5 motor but it has enough power and is pretty quick when in sport mode. All in all a very solid car for the price."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"You don’t even have to take a test drive. You’ll love this Honda and everything about it. Well almost everything. Don’t like these high tech features like lane changing warning or blind spot warning and a few others. But good news is you can turn them off if you want to.
Quiet supple ride with nice handling and good acceleration with the standard turbo.
And if you like roominess this vehicle is for you. Lots of room up front and in the back."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Honda is by far the best u can buy. The CRV is our 3rd, wouldn’t buy anything else."
crv,2 out of 5 stars,"I didn't do enough research before buyimng this.I had a 2005 but got hit by a deer and ran out and bought this even though it felt a lot different.First of all,it is too big.They took a nice compact vehicle and made it as big as a whale.Then it has a CVT and a turbo.Are you kidding me?This thing won't last 50,000 miles.Look for something else"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Live my Honda Cr-V.  This is my third.  I will never have another car.  Very sturdy, drives wonderfully, very comfortable and has all of the amenities.  Truly a drivers dream"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd Honda CR-V. The best car I have ever driven. Great mileage, fairly quiet, plenty of room, rides well, etc. I rate this car and the purchase from Atamian Honda 5 Stars."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Love the simplicity of the classic interior features, too many buttons produces too many distractions in my opinion. Owned a Toyota Rav before and I loved it as well but it got handed down and Momma got a new whip! I love it and it is highly comparable to the Rav!"
crv,2 out of 5 stars,"Have had nothing but problems with the car since we bought it brand new. Hardly any mileage on it. 
6 months in and 
The heated seats are terrible. They are hardy warm and do not stay warm or on. 
The charging/ electrical system is faulty. Charging ports disconnect and stop charging phone and the screen on the car also glitches or just freezes. 
The automatic breaking system is also faulty and has braked for no reasons. 
There is also a bad odour when the AC is on.
None of these were evident upon purchase. We are not thrilled."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"I love this vehicle. Its safe, ergonomic, smart af, smart layout and gorgeous. My favorite vehicle!"
crv,1 out of 5 stars,"I made a huge mistake of sinking my iPhone to my car. Now, my calls and messages are messed up, my steering display shows different from the display on main screen. It is the most user unfriendly display I have ever seen. It is unbelievably frustrating.  Stay away from this car"
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Very impressed with the test drive. Chose this car based on reviews by Edmunds and Consumer Reports.
crv,1 out of 5 stars,Trust me I change cars every 4 to 6 months I cannot keep one more than six months I had all different type of vehicles from sedans to small midsize to 3 row SUVs I had such as Mazda CX 5 and CX 9 Toyota RAV4 and highlander Mercedes GLE 350d and Lexus RX 350 ford edge all were 2016 and newer and the list goes on and on but this CRV was the most disappointing vehicle I've ever own in my life very very lugging acceleration extremely loud engine cheap very cheap interior when al plastic when you shut the doors feels like car is falling apart the only benefit owing this vehicle is yes it is cheap on gas but that's about it there is absolutely nothing else to like about this car if you are on a market for an SUV I highly mean highly suggest you look at the Mazda CX 5 comparing the CX 5 to this it's like day and night they are just not comparable at all.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my new Honda!!!
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Looked at other comparable SUVs but felt safest in this one
crv,5 out of 5 stars,The new cabin seems larger and more comfortable.  The car looks taller and sits higher than my 2018 CRV.  It's a very nice ride - I'm impressed so far.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Great gas mileage, comfortable ride"
crv,4 out of 5 stars,Great everyday vehicle.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Shop around & do research.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,That is a nice and comfortable car nice technology
crv,4 out of 5 stars,Nice car so far. Hope it still run for at least 5 years. I am not a big fan of too much electronic. Electronic will cease to work after a coupes of years.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Great car for the money.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Very smooth to operate.
crv,4 out of 5 stars,I have had my 2021 CRV 2 months.  I am now unable to open trunk 😡 I guess I need to call dealership in am. There is nothing in manual or online I can   see.  Had multiple issues with vin number being incorrect through dealerships.  All in all I love the way it drives .
crv,4 out of 5 stars,All new cars have that new car smell. Unfortunately it’s the off gassing of formaldehyde and other toxic gasses in the seats and dashboard. I am very sensitive to those gasses and I got very sick from the drive home from the dealership. Kept the window open and the a/c on but I still got sick. I’ve been keeping a big fan running in the car with the windows open when I’m not using the car. The smell is finally dissipating. These car manufacturers need to stop using these toxic chemicals. Last time I get a brand new car. Next one will be used.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Great suv in price range under 35k.
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Safety features are great!
crv,2 out of 5 stars,"I bought a 2021 CR-V EX-L taking for granted that in this time and age it would have a built-in navigation system, but it doesn't. You can connect your phone (not user-friendly) and use your internet for navigation. What will happen when there's no internet available while you are on a road trip? For sure Honda will not guide you."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Muy economico comodo y actrativo
crv,5 out of 5 stars,Love my new Honda CR-V Touring.  Great vehicle...

crv,5 out of 5 stars,This car is easy to drive and is great for bringing home groceries and bulky items
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Reliability, attractiveness, luxury and affordability."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,If all the bells and whistles aren't for you great. It allows $$$'s for extended warranties and maintenance plans. The vehicle itself is very nice and roomy
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Love the room, look, and how it drives."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"The perfect small SUV.... Plenty of space, nice ride, great features"

crv,2 out of 5 stars,"Let me count the ways I hate this car. First, I live in Alaska where it gets cold (shocking). This car DOES NOT HEAT UP. The weak autostart only starts it for 10 minutes so I got a new one. Even after 25 minutes of autostarting it doesn't fully heat up. AND, when I'm in it, blasting the defrost, or when it's just on, the air bounces off the windshield into my eyes. Oh yeah, and when I want heat on my feet, GOOD LUCK. Onto #2- There is no lip or gap between the roof and the windshield so if it rains, the water just pours down onto my windshield constantly. Oh, it angers me so. #3- I am not a small woman nor am I large woman, but the seats are uncomfortable. #4- Why not just make it easy to add apps and widgets to the screen? I cannot figure it out for the life of me, and I am not dumb (I don't think).  As for the performance of the car, I get approx 22 MPG city driving.. It drives fine. That's the only plus."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Great car for the money. Took it for a short trip and enjoyed the ride and mileage. Comfortable but every car on the road looks like it, Why do they always ask for reviews right away? Maybe afraid it won't do as well after a few miles."
crv,5 out of 5 stars,"Perfect vehicle for small families and active grandparents. Great car for ferrying kayaks. Handles well, inspires confident driving. Honda safety sensing systems are awful but I don’t have any comparisons. Maybe all cars have issues with this."
crv,3 out of 5 stars,"The car itself is good, has nice standard packages cloth seats are comfortable and ive had very little issues with infotainment. Comfortable car and good looks but it handles terrible, especially when your making left or right turns from a signal you basically have to turn the steering twice to get a nice turn and ive owned SUVs from toyota and turning radius has never been an issue. irs just too loose on the CRV"
