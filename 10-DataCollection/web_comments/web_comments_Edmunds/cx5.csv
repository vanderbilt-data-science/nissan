cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I moved up, way up, from a 2013 GMC Terrain. The CX5 GTR is great! The power is fantastic, the ride is soooo much smoother , and the build quality is in a different universe from the GMC. The CX5 is very quiet, the Bose sound system superb, and the turbo flat out hauls a..... I looked at RAV4, CRV, ENVISION, Santa Fe, and RDX. The RDX was the only one even close, but was way more expensive."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are now a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety and tech features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily used without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn’t as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff – which we don’t.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content – if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.  
We are very happy with our new CX-5."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I just brought home a '21 Signature after owning a 2016 GT for the past 5 years and could not be happier. Mazda's approach seems to be continuous refinement which is apparent in this iteration. My priorities were driving experience--handling, ride, power, AWD snow performance--and also luxury. MPG, minor off-road capability, and cargo space were down the list. Although exterior styling is refined rather than aggressive (see the RAV4), the overall aesthetic remains appealing and the interior is at a near-luxury level. I test drove the '21 RAV4 and it drives ok but simply can't compete with CX-5 (IMO). Although if a person plans to keep a vehicle for 15 years it is hard to beat Toyota's track record.

The Bose system is impressive and the ability to adjust it to individual listening preferences is noteworthy. The new infotainment system has improved significantly over the past 5 years and I am an enthusiastic convert to the no-touch screen and console commander control wheel. The screen resolution and user interface reflect a major evolutionary improvement that was easy to learn based on prior experience. Interior surfaces and design are refined and although some reviewers complain about the lack of a panoramic roof, that was a non-issue for me as I rarely use the existing moon roof. 

My non-turbo 2016 GT was engaging and fun to drive and the '21 Signature takes these characteristics to a new level. I've had it in 4-6"" of snow and it performs very well, even with the all-season OEM Toyo A36s. I was surprised, and hopeful, that they will perform better than the A23s that came on the 2016 GT. Curvy canyon roads elicit a spontaneous smile in any weather--sun to snow.

This Signature is only my second Mazda; previously I owned multiple Subarus (Outback) and a couple Toyota Highlanders. These are great vehicles, but I've now been spoiled by Mazda. I've rented a number of compact SUVs over the past few years ranging from Jeeps to Nissans and Chevy/Fords and none impressed me like Mazdas. I did look briefly at the CX-9 but didn't need the 3rd row. 

The CX-5 Signature checks off all my boxes. Improved Mazda reliability noted by consumer groups is a nice plus and I suspect this reflects their focus on refining, improving, and tweaking existing proven technology (engines, transmission) rather than jumping to the next new thing (e.g., CVTs—ughh). Their turbo has been out for several years and I am hopeful it will hold up well while helping to make the driving experience an absolute pleasure. Turbo lag is minimal, and I suspect that as I learn the throttle characteristics, it will be rare. I think that the Mazda CX-5 is a great and underappreciated (based on sales) vehicle."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"This car lives up to its billing. It drives great, is relatively quiet on the highway, and the red paint job stands out in a crowd of boring white and grey cars that litter the highways. My only complaint is that the seat is too firm for my liking. It purchased a seat cushion to soften it some but then the seat cooling and heating function isn't useful. The interior design is very luxurious for a car that is inexpensive. It's a good choice for those not looking to break the bank and are okay with a small SUV."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I've had my 2021 Signature CX-5 for 2 months now and am thrilled with my purchase. Having owned a 2009 Mazda6 in the past, I expected excellent handling and this vehicle delivers. The steering is quick and accurate with the suspension providing a firm and controlled, but not harsh, ride which I find comfortable and reassuring. The turbo is definitely a good addition to the standard engine. While not a race car, the acceleration is linear with minimal turbo-lag and more than enough from either a standing start or for passing on the freeway.

The interior is very driver friendly and near-luxury. The driver's seat is comfortable and easily adjustable. The cabin is quiet enough for conversation at normal volume even at highway speeds. The 10 inch screen is well placed so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to view. I am not a fan of using a touch screen while driving so I appreciate the control wheel and push button controls which are easy and intuitive to use. I thought having Apple CarPlay/Android Auto was a ""must-have"" for my new vehicle, however I've found that I rarely use the feature since I actually prefer navigating with the Mazda system over Google Maps and usually listen to subscription satellite radio. Nevertheless, it works well when I do connect my phone.

I also appreciate using buttons and knobs for the climate control system rather than having to navigate through screen menus. Again, a thoughtful design to make it easier to use while driving.

All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase and anticipate many miles of enthusiastic driving."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"New additions are automatic folding outside mirrors, cooling seats, larger display, Android Auto, Apple Play, Bose stereo system, heated steering wheel & seats, and so many other safety features. Be sure to get the Grand Touring model."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"This is my second CX-5! I previously had the 2017 CX-5 GT with the Premium Package, which was fully loaded at the time. I knew from day one that when my lease was up I would be getting another one. The 2021 is amazing in every aspect. Comfort, Features, Power. I love the upscale interior, the 10.3 inch screen to be exact! Everything from top to bottom is perfect! I recommend the CX5 to anyone looking for a CUV! It's like driving a BMW for Toyota money."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"The CX 5 GTR is equipped better than most Luxury Compact SUV's.  Mazda has taken care to build the car so it's pleasing to the eye yet is very fun to drive.  It comes standard with more equipment than many Luxury brands and at a reasonable price.  The Turbo 4 has plenty of power and can run on regular fuel.  It may have less cargo space than others in the market, but is more than ample for most uses.  Originally we were looking at the Lexus NX, Acura RDX and Audi Q5, yet the Mazda comes better equipped and a far lower price.  If you are in the market for a Compact SUV, take a look at the CX 5 it will surprise you."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for a safe, stylish, and simple car to drive, the Mazda CX-5 Touring Preferred is your best choice. It gives you leather seats, blind spot monitoring, Apple Carplay, power gate lifting, keyless entry, remote start and so much more. For a reasonable price you can get everything you need to enjoy a short or a long ride. The safety features are one of the highest in the market and the style of the car is comparable to any high-end vehicle for this class, size and price."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,A nice upgrade from my Honda Pilot. Sporty and so much fun to drive. So many extras make this a dream to drive. I am loving my Mazda!
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,This is a peppy small suv.  It handles well.
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"The CX-5 Grand Touring (base trim - no Prem Pkg) is my second Mazda to lease, and overall I'm pretty pleased. Having come from a larger 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5 is a great CUV that fit within my current budget. Its ride is a bit on the firm side, which will take time getting used to, after having the smooth ride of the 9. The non-turbo engine, however, is peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The larger 10.25"" info screen is also really great. The one feature that falls terribly short, in my opinion, is the Bose stereo. The sound, even with the treble at its highest setting, sounds muddy and muffled, and doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose systems in the 9, the new 3's and the very new CX-30. Being in year five of its current generation, the 5 would benefit GREATLY from the same Bose 12-speaker system found in the new 3 and CX-30. That particular upgrade would raise the bar for this CUV sky-high."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I just leased a 2021 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring at the Byers Mazda on Billingsly Road in Dublin, OH. So far the vehicle works great. I wanted to upgrade from my 2018 Mazda 3 hatchback due to hip and back pain in order to assist in comfort and ease in getting in and out of the vehicle and for sitting for long periods of time. In the short time I've driven it, I've already noticed a different. I feel extra safe in this vehicle as it has so many fancy safety options that I didn't even know existed. It is a smooth ride, very quiet, and runs great! This is my third Mazda and even after looking around at other brands, I still chose Mazda. Great quality vehicles, great sales, and great service!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"While this car was originally my third choice––and the last make and model that I test drove––I immediately was sold on the comfort, style, and performance. I drove it 1700 miles within two weeks of the purchase, and it was the most comfortable ride I've ever had. The safety features, the sound system, and so many other factors made the trek through mountain passes and the desert very enjoyable."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Very Happy with the car so far.  The CX-5 has plenty of power with the standard engine.  The car was purchased for my wife and she is the main driver.  She loves the Red color and the optional moon roof and the Alloy wheels.  The CX-5 has plenty of room for even for big guys like me.  I have driven the car about 100 miles so far and it handles great.  My wife on the other hand is still getting used to the handling.  Her last car was a Ford Fusion which had a much different ride. She just needs to drive it more to get used to the different handling.  I have a Chevy Traverse which has a similar ride but softer because its a larger vehicle.  Overall we are both happy with the purchase.  Wayne Mazda in NJ gave us a good deal and we would recommend them.  We narrowed down our decision to three vehicles.  The CX-5, RAV 4, and Nissan Rogue.  I had already made up my mind but my wife was undecided until she saw and I test drove the CX-5.  The style and color won her over."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"I have had my 2021 CX-5 for several days now and for the most part think it is perfect. I purchased a white one in the Grand Touring Reserve trim and it has everything I could ever need. The build quality on literally everything is superb. The one issue I have with it, is in how the stereo system is controlled. There is no way to easily switch through my favorited XM stations without taking my eyes off the road and going through multiple actions on the console control system. Oddly enough, there is a way to semi-easily flip through the 100+ other stations that I don't listen to. Both the Mazda3 and the CX-30 have functionality on the volume knob that allows for switching through your favorites by pressing left or right, but when you pay more money for the CX-5, this isn't included. Overall, I love the CX-5, but if I would have known about this issue before my purchase, it may have been a deal breaker, since it creates a major distraction anytime I want to change the radio station to one of my preset favorites."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"After driving an Audi Q5 for years (which I loved), I actually love my Mazda CX-5 Carbon Edition even more! It feels modern and sleek. I had no intentions of purchasing a new car, let alone a Mazda. They won me over. I am so happy with my purchase."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"It has a really good ride. Are family is coming from a 2014 Buick Enclave. And the Mazda has as smooth a ride, comfort and minimal road noise as the Buick. Fuel economy was the same as the Buick as well. The engine is snappy and plenty of get up and go for traveling. I enjoyed the cruise control option. A person can go in front of you, your car slows down to maintain a safe distance, and then accelerates when able to. Automatically. The steering wheel operation keeps your mind on the road. Will be buying more Mazda’s in the future!!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent car. It is on a different level than Toyota, Nissan, Honda. Of course, all of them make excellent vehicles. But non of them talk to you. They are practical, some are reliable, but it is about it. This car is eye candy inside and out. I am excited to drive to and from work everyday. Fit and finish inside of this vehicle is super. I had plenty of luxury brands to compare. Car is very quite and refined. This is premium vehicle premium and one can pay for it mainstream price. Thank you Mazda. Also, seen someone complainig about Bose system. It is better IMO than Toyota's, Honda's and Subaru's that I tested. Again, for price point it is more than acceptable."
cx5,3 out of 5 stars,"The Mazda CX-5 is a nice SUV as all the reviews agree, but it's not for everyone. The sporty image Mazda is striving for results in heavily bolstered front seats that are not comfortable for everyone. The turbo charged engine is only available on the upper trims pushing $38-40,000, and the Carbon edition with an MSRP of about $33,000. We went looking for the lower priced way to get the turbo, but dealers are treating the Carbon edition like it's already turned into a diamond, adding $5000 to the sticker plus the phoney alarm for $1300 and the Scotch tape on the door edges for $399. Dealers seem to think buyers will forgive and forget these scams when inventories grow in the next few months, but I have never gone back to one dealership that tried to screw me over in the 70's and I have put this Mazda dealership on the same list."
cx5,1 out of 5 stars,"At 55, after buying Fords, a Maserati, and two Nissans and having driven Hondas, Toyotas and several sports cars and SUVs, I purchased my first Mazda based on commercial site reviews.  Looking for safety, reliability, and a great price with a loaded car.  Wanted to down size.  Thought I had found it in the CX-5. My test drive was short. My fault. Because I realized after driving the CX-5 the first day I bought it that that the front seats are beyond terrible. If you are over about 50 or have shoulder or back problems, avoid this car. The seats will make you suffer. We just got back from a 5 hour both ways vacation drive with less than 150 miles on the car starting out and by the time we got back we want to sell it even for a loss. Our backs and shoulders ached the whole time. The seats are so stiff, have no leg room support, and are so ergonomically painful, that no engineer who designed the seats could have driven any time in them or is a moron. We have since researched seat issues with this car and unfortunately  now know that this is a huge issue with this car. Hard to believe that a car company could design a beautiful, highly equipped, reliable and safe car that is ruined by its horrible car seats. We will be selling this brand new car at a loss because it hurts our backs and shoulders and nothing is more miserable than trying to drive a distance in pain because of short, rock hard seats."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Feels like a much more expensive car than it is. Mazda has a lot of nice touches built in to the vehicle.
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"This model and trim is a joy to drive, make sure the sales person reveals all the adds to the window stricker price i.e, mazda price increase, dealer installed options."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"After owning cx9 and 3i , surviving bad accident in the 3 , we decided on another Mazda. Had zero problems with other two. So yes we love our 2021 cx5 gt.
AwD. Daughter got two cx5 also. Reliability and fun are what Mazda's are about! # 1 consumers reports too."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,The 2021 Mazda CX5 handles very well. Great acceleration.  Looks very classy and I love the interior of the CX5. Very sturdy and enjoy driving it! A great vehicle for the price!
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Cons: lower than competitor MPG, cargo room, somewhat boring-looking rear design, a bit chunky, visibility
Pros: Great overall design (especially the front), top-quality interior, great powertrain options. Basically everything else is top notch."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I've had my Signature now for about 6 months and have put 10k miles on it (runs between NC and MA).

First, a shoutout to Edmunds Mazda leasing information person who responded quickly to my request.  Got it just before going into the dealership and shamed them into rolling back the 3x lease rate they wanted initially.  Great info, and wonderful responsiveness!

I had resisted going the SUV route for a long time, but the sporting drivability of this vehicle has won me over.  I love to power into corners and feel the rear-wheel steering adjustment improve the tracking is wonderful.  And yes, the suspension is stiffer than some people like, but it also improves the driving experience for me.  Take a spirited test drive if you're not sure.

Coming from an Infiniti Q50, I still miss rear-wheel drive acceleration on occasion, but it looks like the CX-5 (CX-50) will have that when my lease is up so I can live with this quibble for now.  And although the CX-5 doesn't have all the luxury bells of the Infiniti, I still love getting 90% of it at 65% of the price!

Another ding is space, for people and for storage.  I have not had any complaints about people feeling like there's not enough room for them, so not a problem for me.  I will admit to occasionally wishing for a few more inches of storage space though.  I can work through it by reclining the front passenger seat though, so no showstoppers yet on the storage side.

Fit and finish are very well done.  I wasn't sure initially about the Caturra leather being the only seating option (brown?), but it's such a rich color I love it.  Ergonomically, I would wish for more aggressively bolstered seats, but my friends all think the seats function great from their perspectives.

The non-touch screen required only a short acclimation period; the controls in the center console are easy to find by touch and then get to navigation, entertainment, or communications.  I'll grouse about my inability to use voice controls effectively, but it's most likely me.

All in all, a great first SUV for me, and a great choice for others!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Owning a Honda Pilot for 9 years, I knew it was too big and thirsty for my current needs. But I was concerned about feeling cramped in a compact CUV. No worries there. The CX-5 was extremely comfortable, well-appointed, and packed with features for the price. I test drove a Carbon Turbo and a Touring preferred pkg at my first dealership. I had seen reviews say the base engine was a bit weak, but I found the regular engine to have plenty of pep and power. In fact, because of traffic, I didn't get to really open the turbo up during the test drive. I realized with my driving patterns, I really wouldn't have much need for the Turbo. 

The Carbon Edition is basically the Touring trim with the SV Preferred package items and some trim items unique to this level. Including a paint color called Polymetal Grey, which is actually a very sharp steely blue. It also has a different grill, black wheels, black trim around the wheel wells. On the interior, the black leather seats are accented with red stitching. A red interior is also available, which I though would look horrid, but actually looks pretty sweet in person.

As good as the car looks, it's also fun to drive. Very responsive and handles well. Loaded with safety and convenience features that make driving a pleasure. 

As I said in the title, I drove the CX-5 first, but wanted to see what else was out there. Anything else I drove just left me flat. Wasn't even close. So the CX-5 it was. Buy this car, and you'll be looking for reasons to go for a drive."
cx5,2 out of 5 stars,"Owned probably 30 vehicles in my lifetime from pretty much every mfg. But, hadn't owned a Mazda until my wife showed up with her new grocery getter. Loaded with options for the price and some neat high end convenience. Sensing wipers, levelling headlights and a nice comfortable ride. We live just outside the city and have about 2 miles of dusty dirt roads. Six months into her vehicle she seems to be having sensor problems. I'm not talking about intermittant issues, but sensor failure. Her biggest problem is the levelling headlight sensing issues as although they have been reset a couple of times, they had to be replaced under warranty. This is a car that has 10,000 miles and is 6 momnths old. 

Have other vehicles in our driveway that are a few years older with headlight levelling and have not had an issue. So, the vehicle may be a 5* vehicle for paved roads in the city but in my opinion there are better choices for those on the outskirts."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Some dealers were competitive on the price of CX-5. Some dealers were not as responsive (3 or 4 days to respond) to our quote request and another gave us the MSRP price minus $100. What sold us with the Trade-In value we received.  There was a big disparity between dealers on the Trade-in value.   
In the price range of the CX-5 we felt we received a good value for the money.   There were better driving SUV's but once you added options we use then then the value wasn't there."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"i have owned over the years 28 Mazda . i own a 2021 CX5. over all i love the car great handling super nice on the inside . i love every thing but the transmission .it some times shifts hard . but what i dont like is when i am getting on a free way where  the speed limit is 70mph . i put the trans. into sport mode. because it is faster  throught the gears . and i can keep up with the on comming cars . i put the gas pedal to the floor and very fast reach 72 mph the tack is at 6,000 rpm  and the trans wont go into drive. when i take my foot off of the gas pedal  i am now running 72 mph and i cant get the trans to go into drive  the cars in frount of me are getting closer .i am doing every thing to slow it down  so at the last min. i put the shifter into N and back into drive that worked . being i race cars on a race track .i was thinking fast on how to slow the car down . i feal that some one who .would not think fast  enought . might crash there car into some one on a free way. i have taken the CX5 back to the dealer ship  they did a update  on the trans to make shift better but it did not work . it still does the same thing . i have told mazda corp. about it and never herd back from mazda . i do know that this trans is in   the 2021 cx5 is  brand new  for 2020 and 2021    and is way different .from other mazda transmissions  i feal mazda does not have the bugs worked out yet on this new trans"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"great handlng ,good safety features,beautiful red color,quick,smallish back seat,fair fuel economy"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,This is a great handling car. To get the same level of driving you would have to step up to more luxury brands. None of the mainstream brands come even close. Great reliability ratings. Premium interior and superior fit and finish. Quite too.
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Luxurious interior at a value price. Fun to drive. Standard equipment tires are not up to this cars standards.
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I've just upgraded from a  2018 Mazda 3 to a  2021 CX5 .  I love them both.    They both handle well, never had any issues with the 3 and expect the same with the CX5.  Mazda has me hooked!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a new 2021 Grand Touring w/Premium Pkg. Dark Blue w/black leather. It's FWD and non-turbo which is perfect for our driving style and region. The engine is plenty peppy and the 6 speed auto shifts like perfection. The interior is very luxurious. Heated and cooled seats. Bose stereo. Heads up display feels like you're driving a Vette. Memory seats which is great since me & my spouse both use the car and ratcheting the drivers seat manually in our old car was a pain. Now we just push a button. Wife likes the power liftgate, something our old car didn't have either. Really like the way it drives. My only complaint would be the budget tires they use. I'll give Mazda a pass but it's one shortcoming for such a fine automobile. Haven't really checked fuel mileage yet but expect 28-32 average. Plan to keep this for many years."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"I have always owned Honda and Acura products, but with the shortage, and the economy, I decided to down size from my Acura MDX lease. If you notice with the shortage, lots are pretty empty.  I could have waited for the right Honda I wanted, but the Mazda's were in stock, hence the CX-5 and CX-9 rocket in sales the last two months.
 The interior of the Mazda is very nice.  All the materials feel top notch, except for the lower doors and the floor mats and carpet. Worst Floor Mats and carpet ever!  Cheap and hard to vacuum.  
The Infotainment screen is finally larger, but working it is annoying with the knob controller.  I have gotten used to it, but would not buy it again just for that.  Voice commands are not much better.
Little things like the heated steering wheel is only warm on the sides, not the top or bottom, and the button is on the console?  The power seat setting and memory is on the seat itself, and does not light up at night.  When you set your power seat, it does not set your mirrors as well, so after maintenance or car wash, I always have to adjust them, unlike my previous car which adjusted with the hit of the memory seat button
The rear headrest should be able to slide down and be flush with the back seat (Acura does) for better visibility
I got the regular 2.5 engine, as I am not a fan of Turbo's.  While it is decent enough, the transmission could be quicker.  Gas mileage is also disappointing for a 4cyl with a six speed auto.
Overall it is a very nice SUV, but with just a little stretch of that wheelbase and maybe better OEM tires, the ride could be just that much better.  I will be replacing the TOYO tires with Michelin when the time comes.  I usually only keep my cars for 3 years but did not lease, but we will see"
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"Things I love: 
- fun to drive 
- great handling 
- good gas mileage 
- should be very reliable 
- price was right 
- AWD handles well in rain, I suspect it will also do well in the snow 
- Carbon Edition paint makes it easy to find in a sea of CX-5s 
- the black seats with red stitching (looks magenta, in my opinion) is unique and really nice 
- the black rims are gorgeous 
- I get lots of compliments and questions about how much I like it 

Things I don’t love: it just isn’t as nice as I expected. At a glance, it’s very polished and riding around in it is plenty comfortable and seems luxurious. But, the fit/finish doesn’t impress me. The first time I cleaned it up, I noticed that anything immediately out of sight is not upholstered/finished. On that note, the carpet is hard to get clean, particularly removing dog hair (but perhaps that’s specific to my two beasts). The glossy surfaces scratch if you touch them with anything other than a fingertip and the other surfaces also seem easy to damage (four months of my six year old climbing across the back seat has scratched the rear console pretty badly; a Rubbermaid bin leaned against the dash for 20 minutes left an indentation that took a week+ to recover). The front fender popped out within the first few weeks of owning it, but I was able to pop the clip back in with some effort. 

Would I buy it again? With my budget, yes. I’m hoping it will be as reliable as three trusted mechanics (and Consumer Reports) told me it will be. However, if I had another few thousand dollars, I would pick something else."
cx5,1 out of 5 stars,"Started out at the dealer. Test drove the cx 5 GT signature and ended up getting it home and noticed pathetic performance as it didn't have the turbo and the seats were too hard. took it back to the dealer and upgraded to the reserve thinking it was the same as the car we test drove. Turn out it had the same seats as the other and the signature had upgraded seats. I loved the acceleration with the turbo and the windshield display but that's where it ended.  the seats were too hard and driving a short distance my back was on fire, when the fuel light came on you only had a few miles to find gas and not having a touch screen was not desirable. The biggest disappointment was the height of the rocker panel. It was too high off the ground and when you had to literally climb in and the floor pan was so deep it was like getting into a swimming pool. My wife had an artificial hip and it took her several minutes just to get in and out. Installing running boards didn't even help We drove it for about three months and couldn't take it no more. We realized why drive a car that you hate. We started checking out other cars thoroughly and decided on a Honda CR-V. We took a huge hit but I'm now in a car that I thoroughly enjoy, we can get in and out of it with no problem at all and the seats are very comfortable"
cx5,3 out of 5 stars,"Bought new in Jan.21. Wife wanted vehicle I was initially ok with it but have come to the decision that it wasn't the best for our money. Interior space is not up to the best. Interior color and black leather make for really dark,drab interior. Seats are not that comfortable. Sunroof small. Wind noise while driving with windows down very irritable, Gas mileable ok but not great (28mpg).Acceleration adequate with standard engine. Value for price adequate. Everyone loves steering, I find it uninspiring and steering wheel to thin. Whoever designed the interface for using all the car's features should be forced to use them everyday to get their pay and food; horribly laid out and frustrating. Pallette of exterior colors not very appealing. This is my 3rd Mazda and although time will tell on dependability I expect it to be good. Visabilty not up to the best in class. Vehicle looks are subjective but it's decent. Doing your own oil changes not the easiest I've seen. Truly this vehicle should have about a 3 day tutorial from Mazda on how to get the most from it. On the positive side it doesn't have the dreaded CVT tranny. Gets excellent safety ratings. Comes with a real temp.spare tire. AWD system again not the best but adequate for 90% of people. Warranty adequate but not the best. Adequate seems to be the word of the day and I was wishing for delightful,fun and enjoyable. The auto press is enamored with this vehicle, me, I wish Suzuki was still here, Subaru hadn't become PC and expensive and the new Mitsu Outlander had been available a couple of months sooner. That or I could have talked the wife into another Chrysler minivan with all of its utility, comfort and ease of access. But minivans are not cool to the female set. Sad. Ok, have now owned for 10 months and put 15k on it. Dependability as expected excellent. Still finding it irritating and somewhat uncomfortable. Sunroof is useless without some sort of wind blocker which it does not have. Same for driving with windows down, going to have to get wind blockers for them too. Mileage a bit better at 29 but drive mostly highway. Back up camera is constantly dirty or covered in water so a bit irritating. Just not feeling it as the hip people say."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I had a 2017 and 2019 Kia Ex pack Sportages. Loved them both bot no comparison to the CX5. The interior is the biggest plus. Near luxury. Design is second to none. I bought the Soul Red with white interior .... eye catching. 
In Mexico we have the S Touring model, works perfect for my needs. Extremely quite and a lot more power than the Kias. I would highly recommend!

Update: It's been 6 months plus since I bought this car. Happier today than the day I brought it home. MPG on the road in the mid to.low 30's. This is near luxury on a dime."
cx5,3 out of 5 stars,"We test drove the Mazda CX-5 with the intention to buy it, based on favorable reviews we had read. We felt, however, that the backseat was too cramped for our three young adult sons, the engine lacked pep, and the interior was nothing special. We went with the Honda CR-V and are very pleased that we did."
cx5,1 out of 5 stars,"The Mazda CX-5  signature is great car for the value, but it is no luxury vehicle. I traded my old BMW for this car thinking it was good choice. But I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from safety features were annoying, and the driver’s seat leather started to wrinkle after only 2 months. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn’t realize how much I’d miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car. Thankfully. I paid cash for the CX-5. I looked at several luxury vehicles and traded it for another (new) BMW X3. The BMW drives like a dream, has light interior and a panoramic sunroof. I’m so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn’t cost much more than the signature. I’d rather have a true luxury vehicle for that price range. I won’t make that mistake again."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,We are ecstatic about our CX-5.  We color we chose is a red that looks like no other and white interior that makes it pop!  We love our new car and now huge Mazda fans!!!
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Love this car! RX-7 DNA, on par with German luxury for thousands less.

We bought it two months ago, 1400 miles to date. Smooth, quiet, peppy, responsive with awesome safety features. Fit and finish is exceptional. Rides and handles as well as our BMW 3 series and reminds me of an RX-7 I had a long time ago. Averaging 24 mpg in town, 27+ highway. Roomier inside than it appears.

Only complaints are minor and nitpicks. Wish there was a knob to tune the radio stations. Many car companies don’t have these anymore. Mazda works around this with a favorites button that isn't too bad. The seat bottom cushions could be longer. Otherwise the car is perfect."
cx5,2 out of 5 stars,"I test drove the Touring trim. Drive was not impressive; engine lacked power of other similar sized SUVs, suspension lacked refinement and comfort, and seats are designed for little people. Exterior and interior design was ho hum. I returned to the dealership after a test drive, grabbed my trade-in key and moved on. It is way over rated compared to other SUVs in the same market."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Bmw and Mercedes should be concerned.
cx5,1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this vehicle mostly based on its safety features, but I’ve quickly grown to hate driving my 2021 CX-5. The main problem is the automatic transmission. Shifting in/out of low gear(s) is horrible, accompanied by lurching and thumping, when starting or stopping but especially when cornering. The shifting is too frequent and way too rough. Aside from that, the engine (Touring) is slightly under-powered, and the braking is substantially under-powered. So this CX-5 takes forever to catch up to traffic from a stop light, then you have to press the brake pedal too much to slow to a stop, while the rough transmission is jerking the vehicle around. Unfortunately the 2021 CX-5 is garbage and I’m sad that I’m stuck with this piece of junk until it’s paid off, but I’m so glad we hung onto our older (2016) CX-3 so I can just leave this horrible CX-5 in my garage until I can get a better replacement vehicle … I doubt I will ever consider buying another Mazda after owning this CX-5, despite being quite happy with our Mazda CX-3, CX-9 and MPV. It’s just too awful."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"So far loving the car ,the features, how it rides there is nothing I don’t like yet"
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,I just know that there are different levels even in the grand touring which I was not made aware at the time of my purchase
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,I loved my 2016 CX-5 GT so much that I had to get the new 2021 GT Reserve.  I got the Soul Red Crystal with the white interior and I couldn't appreciate more how fun this is to drive.
cx5,3 out of 5 stars,"I looked at many cars before I chose the CX-5.  It had the best looking interior without going into the premium market.  There wasn't much hard, cheap plastic in the interior.  The dash wasn't overly busy like an airplane cockpit.  The mileage is good at 30.3/gallon.  I like the manual shift option which I use in the winter and hilly terrain.  The knocks are no heated review mirrors without going up the Grand Touring Trim.  At that time, the CX-3 offered heat rear view mirrors on the Touring trim.  Living in the Northeast, this is a safety feature for us.  The warranty is poor, 3 years/30,000 miles.  Other car brands are leaving this in the dust.  No CD player which almost all brands don't offer.  At that time, Suburu still offered it.  The long front snout makes it more difficult to judge distance.  In the end, my biggest disappointment is no heated rear view mirrors. This could have been added as an option in a package without paying an extra $2000 to go up into another trim for other stuff not needed."
cx5,2 out of 5 stars,"Very slow and horrible fuel efficiency. The display is a joke. My Jetta that was two years old when I traded it was a joy ride compared to this boring,  inefficient,  slow and non intuitive piece of junk. Can’t wait for my lease to be over."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"After the untimely demise of my previous vehicle, I rented a CX-5 and thought to test drive a CX-5 Signature.

First off, this car is very comfortable. Never before did I realize what I was missing without a heated steering wheel.

The ride is very comfortable and the turbo provides enough power to be taken seriously on the highway when merging or passing.

The entertainment system controls are knob controlled in the median area just set back from the gear shift.

All the fancy cameras and radars are also quite the upgrade.  This thing could probably park itself (but doesnt).

My only disappointment is the gas mileage; I get about 22 mpg, and it seems that 93 premium is recommended.

The AWD is a huge improvement in rainy conditions and I look forward to tackling any snow this winter."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Never a Mazda or SUV fan but needed the AWD. Seats are leather but seem to be a bit hard. It is the GT model and it drives well although I do find it struggling to accelerate quickly and often seems lost between gears. Feels like the motor is winding while the transmission waits too long to up-shift. The infotainment system takes a little while to get used to because it is not a touch screen and I have a feeling the scroll wheel will be a point of failure at some time in the future. I personally don't like the way Mazda's look but it is growing on me. How could I buy a vehicle I don't find attractive? It has what I need and the price was right. I would highly suggest a turbo model.
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Top notch SUV experience plus Mazda integrity,craftsmanship,and style. The best SUV I’ve owned."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"Was a little skeptical since we previously bought a CR-V and really liked it.  When we drove the CX-5 it really sold us.  Handled great and was fun to drive.  Can't really say that about the CR-V, which is a great car, but I wouldn't categorize it as ""fun"".  There was snow on the road when we drove the CX-5 and it had no issue.  Would have liked to get a 2022 but none available.  The dealer didn't charge over sticker like all the other dealers in Chicagoland so that was a huge advantage.  So far super happy with the vehicle."
cx5,2 out of 5 stars,"Within 5 days of owning this car, the electrical system experienced a major malfunction. The steering went out, the brakes went out and the only thing that minimized the damage in the collision this malfunction caused was the automatic braking system. I brought the car to the dealership who has a Mazda technician come out and evaluate the vehicle. They said nothing was wrong. I paid an independent collision specialist to come run the cars system and they found a whole host of issues including bad sensors, faulty analog to digital transformers and missing grounds. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. I traded it in and got a Tiguan. I don’t recommend Mazda. They’re trying to go up market with a down market price and you get what you pay for."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Awesome ride and beautiful inside and out
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"My new 2021 Mazda CX-5 looks and feels like a luxury vehicle - for the price of a typical crossover suv.  Amazing look, feel, and entertainment system.  I leased my new car at Charlottesville Flow Mazda with the help of Ray Jordan.  He made my first time renting a car quick, easy, and fun.  The car is fantastic and I could not have found it without the help of amazing salesman Ray Jordan."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"1-2 months ago I bought a CX5. A large part of my getting this SUV is because with my age and arthritis a car which is higher off the ground is easier to get in and out of than a sedan which is low to the ground. My decision was also based on my having read in Consumer Reports magazine that Mazda as a company was rated first place in their cars' reliability. Reviews in car magazines mentioned that the CX5's turbo-charger gives it a 0-60 mph time of about 6 seconds which pins me to the seat when I stomp on the accelerator in a highway entrance ramp. it also handles like it's glued to the road, which is in part a characteristic of the 4 wheel drive and the large tires. I have the top of the line ""signature"" model. It's heads up display is great and you can even alter the position of where on the lower windshield the display is projected - it can be moved vertically and horizontally. Another great option is that the accessory computer display is not a touch screen. My wife's car has a touch screen and I have to reach for it which takes my eyes off the road. The CX5's display is controlled by a 2.5 inch rotary knob which is just behind the gear-shift. That knob not only turns, but also tilts side to side, making selecting options easier than a touch screen. Right next to that knob is a small rotary knob which controls the radio's volume - pushing on it vertically turns the radio on or off. That display always shows the time. The doors lock automatically when the car reaches about 10 mph. There's two seat position memory buttons. The windshield wipers turn on automatically in the rain. The arm rest box has two USB-A outlets. The front seats can be heated or cooled. The steering wheel can be heated. The side rear view mirrors can be folded in and they also do so when you turn the car off. The center display can show you a 360 degree view, and automatically shows a front view when you're near something ahead like when I park in my home's garage it prevents me from running into the garbage pails. I'm not keen in the very large size of the key fob and its buttons are too small and are too easily pushed unintentionally, but it contains a conventional key inside of it, and you can easily replace the internal button battery. The headlights have an enormous lateral field of view. There's little room for an adult to fit in the back seats, but I bought the car as if it were a two seat car."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"Nice little crossover. Comfortable, packed with tech & safety and stylish. I don't think it looks as good as an Acura RDX, but a similarly equipped RDX would have been close to $10K. For me, that just wasn't worth it. Turbo engine is nice and I am getting about 27 MPG, mostly highway. No complaints from me."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,I wanted the visual on the windshield
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Beautiful car inside & out!
cx5,2 out of 5 stars,"The high tech features are a continuing irritation. Some I can turn off but the ""advanced keyless entry with push button start"" is a daily irritant. After opening the driver side front door and walking to the garage door, waiting for my wife to come out, the doors lock automatically. What a monumental irritant. I also don't like the large key fob that makes my key chain unwieldy (I will also need a new key fob battery every year) another nuisance. I also find the engine noisy under acceleration with transmission shift hesitancy and roar. It was a mistake buying this car. Not to mention the low fuel economy for a 2.5L engine."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,Great value
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,I love everything about it !
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I have the 2021 Grand Touring with the standard 2.5L.  White exterior with black leather.  This is our 4th CX-5 and is my favorite one so far.  The standard 2.5 has plenty of punch for me.  It is zippy around town and fun to drive with enough punch to get the job done on the highway.  I really like the cylinder cut-off feature.  With the display set to monitor the cylinder activation, it amazes me just how smoothly this car transitions from 4, to 2, to complete shut-off, and back to 4 cylinders.  It is seamless.  In my 2016 CX-5 the best I was able to get on the highway was about 32-33mpg.  In this 2021 with the cylinder cut-off I just completed two trips on the highway and achieved 39.6 mpg and 41.5 mpg.  This was a true measured calculation from fill-up to fill-up, with documented mileage.  The pump was always stopped at the auto cut-off on each fill-up.  I was extremely pleased with that performance.  This was achieved with the air conditioner turned off, windows up and cruise control set at no more then 5mph over the limit.  This engine really rewards you for smooth throttle input on the highway.  I could not be more pleased.

From our previous experience with the CX-5's, I know that the all wheel drive system is excellent on the road and I have always been pleased with the handling in light to moderate snowfalls here in PA.  The newer models have stepped things up in the safety department with many welcome features geared towards keeping you safer on the road.  Two thumbs up Mazda!!"
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with my purchase even though at the moment MSRP is a deal.  This is my second CX-5, my first was a 2018 Grand Touring.  The 2021 has the upgraded screen which is a bit bigger and higher definition. Same styling as my older car but the Turbo edition gives me a bit more oomph as I get on the highway or need to pass another car without having to kick it into sport mode.  I would love to see wireless CarPlay in newer editions.  Plus a bumper guard and at this trim level a cargo mat and all weather mats would be nice too.  Otherwise the styling is on point and sexy. Love the lines of this car and believe you get a lot more in this class of car compared to the Honda, Toyota or Subaru.  The attention to detail in the inner cabin and the comfort level is far superior."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Needed a new car do to Kia engine replacement which takes 3 months.  We had rented a cx5 over the summer.  It is the nicer model in this small suv line up.  The interior seems plush and refined compared to other models
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,I love my cx5.  This suv looks like a luxury car without the price.  I chose the crystal mica blue beautiful
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"My husband and I were looking for a size upgrade from my (purchased previous to meeting him) 2017 Honda HR-V. He's 6'3"", and let's just say it was a struggle.
I researched new vehicles online for a few months. Full disclosure- my list only included 0% financing offers. While I wanted to stay in an SUV, Mazda was running a special on the 6 at the time. Having never driven a car, I thought ""why not test drive it and see"". Side note- it was absolutely fabulous... but same problem, not a great fit for the hubby. We were on our way out when our salesman asked if we had looked at the CX-5. My first thought was ""nope, too much $, will not pay for financing""... but we took a look anyway and I sure did like what we saw. Now, we are not ""fancy"" people. I did not want leather/sunroof/bells/whistles/etc... just a solid, reliable, small SUV with enough cargo space for groceries and the occasional small furniture purchase. I was definitely interested in the newer safety features available, but thought they would not be an option without a high-level trim. I was wrong. One test drive in the CX-5 Touring and we were in love. Plenty of head/leg room, extraordinary amount of standard safety features, good gas mileage, luxurious interior, unique exterior styling, sturdy build, comfortable, and fun to drive... all at the right price point ($29k). Happy ending, we did get the 0% financing and the perfect compact SUV to fit our needs. Have had it for 4 months now and have no complaints. Definitely recommend!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Nice SUV easy to drive have a lot of space good technology
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,Luxury without the luxury price tag
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"This car is awesome. We bought this compact suv as an upgrade from a small four door Chevy sedan. It’s large enough for an infant car seat, and can hold quite a bit with the seats laid flat. Loving this thing. It’s classy, reliable, attractive and a steal at $30k."
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,So far (125 miles) so good.
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"I’m absolutely loving my cx-5, there are so many safety features and it’s purely luxury"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"HIGHS: Power at all levels.Absolutely fun car to drive! The only car I ever owned that has the ideal seating position. Love the go-kart-like handling. Love the heated steering wheel and seats. The auto wipers and lights remove one more thing that takes your mind off of driving. Great sound. system
LOWS: Ugly wheels!!! The navigation system is too complex and primitive. Info system takes a long time to master-It still gives me fits. Could use more lighting at night on switches, some you can't see at all.50 more horsepower would make it a bomb!!!"
cx5,5 out of 5 stars,"This car has been nothing but a joy to drive. The ride is smooth and the handling is on point. The interior is solid and doesn't feel cheap. The driver safety features really are helpful. At first I thought they would get annoying, but just yesterday I would have hit someone while switching lanes because he was completely in my blind spot. The warning beeped as soon as I put on my signal to change lanes!  The vehicle also has so much pick-up that I never use the optional ""sport"" accessory to boost speed. If I had to say one negative thing it would be that it's not awesome on gas. But I guess when you buy a Turbo that is to be expected."
cx5,4 out of 5 stars,"The Mazda marriage with Toyota make this a contender. Good build well balanced drives well in city and down the highway. Long list of safety features standard.
The 2.5l SKYACTIV-G and 6speed trans are next to bullet proof 
The only 2 issues that keep this from being a 5 star pick is 
1) the keyfobs have the buttons on the edge and I often set off alarm/lock/unlock by just carrying keys in pocket
2) the Mazda Connect system is weak. No touch screen and a clumsy menu make this a frustrating feature. The only savior is Apple carplay and Android"
