Factory installed would have been ideal but wasn’t in stock at time of purchase.  I am particularly impressed with mileage.  So far approx 43% of my overall miles are electric, however mostly short haul trips.  No regrets!  Very happy so far but time will tell how it holds up."
escape,5 out of 5 stars,"Our 2021 Escape Hybrid/Titanium if fabulous- 51 MPG in the first 10 mile trip driving home from the dealer and I have pictures to prove it!  We have been getting 40-45MPG with mid-range gas in our driving over the past several weeks. The Hybrid drive and CVT make it very smooth starting and stopping which is very important for a family member who has had extensive neck and back issues and the battery pack shifts the center of gravity back toward the rear wheels making the hybrid much more nimble than the fully gas powered Escape. It's AWD and navigates the narrow, poorly maintained mountain road to our home with no issues.  Power is more than adequate on the highway. We are very happy with this vehicle."
escape,4 out of 5 stars,"Considered the Honda CRV but chose the redesigned Escape titanium version instead.  Liked the stronger 250 hp engine and its traditional transmission versus CVT in the Honda.  The tech features (nav, HUD, app, safety) are significantly newer and at 6' tall I seemed to have a bit more leg room in the cockpit.  I also really liked the panoramic sunroof option and a bit more comfortable seats.  The car seems significantly more refined than the older generation CRV to me and the color and wheel choices appealed more to me.  I love the antimatter blue.  Negatives:  In higher trim levels the Ford appears at least 10% more expensive than the Honda (apples to apples) and it's historical resale value is poorer as well.  The Ford's interior is also not real impressive, seat materials even at the highest trim level (titanium elite) are cheap and hard plastics abound.  Most upper level configurations end with a black interior, no grays are offered. It's unfortunate you have to order the highest trim level to get digital gauges, LED lights and an electronically dimming rear view mirror; they are not offered individually.  Ford links interior choice to wheel selection which is also annoying.   All  in all I am happy with my choice (so far) and pleased to be driving an American car for the first time in 30 years."

escape,2 out of 5 stars,"The vehicle is ok.  I wanted to buy an economy SUV, and buy American.  I was really disappointed when my headlights fogged up in 7 months due to the supposed air flow and Ford said that it is normal and they won’t replace them.  My new car now looks years old.  Very disappointed with Ford customer service and learned a valuable lesson.  Don’t buy this car."
escape,1 out of 5 stars,"I picked up a brand new Ford Escape 2021 on 4/26/21.  Two weeks after I picked it up, the check engine light came on and I could no longer drive the car in reverse.  I could go forward if I wanted to, but silly me, I thought I was going to have a car that could do both.  Took it to the dealership, but by the time they saw the car, the check engine light went out and it could go in reverse so they could not fix what they could not see.  Today once again the check engine light came on and once again, the car would not go in reverse.  Another trip to the dealer and a wasted five hours (getting a ride home took up the majority of that time) of my time before they determined that a part needed to be over-nighted.  So here I sit at home waiting for an overnight part delivery.  I do not have a vehicle to get to work tomorrow and who knows when I will have transportation again.  I do, however, have a really nice lease payment to make, so there is that.  Don't buy a Ford because getting in touch with them to file a complaint is not easy.  Thank God this is a two year lease.  I will find another brand the next time to lease."
escape,2 out of 5 stars,"Car bought brand new in September 2020. In April I brought car into dealer because rear shocks were  leaking , drivers door broke, brake issues and auto hatchback had hit me in the head while loading car . I just got this car back two weeks ago . Hatchback and brake issue not resolved . When you spend 40000 thousand on a car do don’t expect to have these kind of issues as well as not having the car for 6 months .Dealership dropping the ball many times adding to the frustration along be unable to reach any executives in the corporate office"
escape,1 out of 5 stars,"After trading in my lease early with my 2019 Ford Edge, which we loved the 2021 Escape is horrible. 
 
I hear a significant flapping and thumping noise that sounds like it comes mostly from the right rear wheel area and to a slightly lesser degree across the entire rear of the vehicle. It is a concussion type of noise and I don’t hear it when the windows are down. It does not record well, but passengers tell me it is more prominent when they are in the back seat area than when in the from seat. It is more noticeable on smooth roads as bumps and rough pavement is loud enough to mask the flapping.
The dealership reported a loose screw on the front was replaced, but the noise did not abate. I have crawled underneath and do not see anything loose, but the material the wheel wells are made of is extremely pliable and is not attached to anything structural on the back side of the tire. The rear bumper is also very flexible and has nothing rigid to attach to on the lower part of the bumper. I can flex and fold these materials easily and when “thumbed” they make a similar flappy type noise as I hear while driving at speeds over 45 and under 65.
Going in for the second time at Greico Ford in DelRay Beach to try and get rid of this annoying sound."

escape,5 out of 5 stars,"This is my fifth Escape. I have loved all of them for their reliability, good looks, and low maintenance. My new one is a 2021 Escape Titanium Hybrid. I’ll admit to being a little scared of all the bells and whistles, but it’s a great drive and is so beautiful!  Highly recommend."
