forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, great head room, superb views from all windows. Substantial cargo area in hatch. Large glove compartment. Turn signals are not obnoxious, as most vehicles tend to be. Windshield and rear window wipers are large- sweep very well. Steering radius is fantastic!!!"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I researched all the small and medium-size SUVs for a replacement for our 2016 Hyundai Tucson Eco and the Forester seemed the best choice. It broke our string of five no-problem Hyundais going back to 2000. The Forester delivers in all categories. It's roomy, economical and safe. The gas mileage is between 33-35 on the highway and 31-33 combined. It's about the same as the Tucson. A lot of magazines criticize the CVT transmission, but it's a welcome change from the dual-clutch in the Tucson which was really the only complaint. The Forester is more comfortable and has more cargo space. It's quiet on the highway and the full-time 4-wheel drive is fantastic in the rain. I love the car. Only complaint is that trying to figure out all the electronics is baffling. But, eventually, that will come around. One feature I don't like is that the engine shuts off when you stop in traffic for more than a few seconds. When you lift your foot off the brake, it sort of bangs back to life. There is a switch to override this function, but you have to turn it on every time you drive the car. There should be a permanent override or simply do away with this supposedly environmental function. We purchased the base model which had the wheel upgrade and interior rubber mat package. Our dealership was fantastic to work with and overall I feel we got a great deal."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"After 30 plus years driving Toyota vehicles I am a picky hard sell to change.  My dealership would not deal with me so I changed to Subaru with hopes of similar reliability.  My 2021 Forester limited has more options than a RAV4 limited and for over 3k less.  Standard AWD, comfortable ride and better mpg.  Just did a 300 mile weekend trip and the vehicle was great!  So far very happy with my first Subaru.
9/25/21 - not one issue with the new Forester.  Still rides quietly and solid with 3k miles.  I find the agile handling is confident and quick.  I like the eyesight auto cruise driving system to be very helpful for long drives.  In mostly city driving I’m averaging 24 mpg.  Great vehicle.
3/27/22
Odo reads 6k miles.  My Subie has been problem free.  Owning 3 previous Camrys I needed an suv that was comfortable and quiet.  The engine roars during hard starts but is still quieter than the RAV4.  Comfy drives and highway trips avg 31 mpg."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"We purchased this car to replace our 2007 Edge.  Was not sure if we were going to like it since it was not as heavy.  But after driving it, we Love it.  It is almost the same size as the Edge and has much better visibility.  It has plenty of pep with the Boxer 4 cylinder and do not have to deal with a turbo.  I like to do my own oil changes and this car has the oil filter sitting right up on top in the front with the threads down...so easy and no mess.  The transmission is sealed so I do not have to deal with the fluid.  We got the base model with a couple of upgrades....roof rack and 17 in alloy wheels.  There is still plenty of neat things on it without spending the extra money....unless you want them, which we did not.   All in all, the more I drive this car the more I like it."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Just traded in my 2015 Subaru Outback 2015 Limited for a 2021 Forester Premium. I may have given up a teeny bit of luxury but I gained immensely in new safety features, those adaptive LED headlights and all that wonderful open interior and panoramic sunroof. I love that it is much shorter and narrower than the outback and it is a smooth wonderful ride.  Nice pick up. I am really enjoying my new Forester!!"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Love the safety features especially the front & back eyesight driving.  Sure helps when backing out of busy parking lots!  It also alerts you of auto & pedestrian movement on the sides of your vehicle. Great safety feature!

Also for those that have difficulty driving in the dark, the headlights turn with the car so no blind spots on corners plus you can set the lights to bright & they will automatically dim when another vehicle is detected & then return to bright once it has passed.  

Alot to love about being a Subaru owner!"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Picked up my 2021 Forester Touring on Saturday and wish I had looked at Subaru years ago.  A much better product than Honda.  Solid in every aspect - my prior 2019 CRV was all over the road in bad weather (snow, rain and wind).  Made the switch to go back to AWD and it is like night and day.  IMHO there is plenty of acceleration to get on and pass on the highway (was worried when reading reviews) but it has plenty of get up and go!  Comfortable and a pleasure to drive - went out on Sunday and drove over 150 miles and didn't realize it - did not want to get out of the car.  The only complaint - and it is MINOR - is the placement of the lap seat belt attachment.  Different placement and size compared to the Honda, but everything else is top of the line.  Lots of tech (if you want to use it).  As a long term Honda owner (owning the Pilot, CRV, Element and Odyssey) the Forester is hands down the best vehicle I have owned."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"So far this vehicle has proven to be every thing I read about it and even better on gas.  A lot of  electronics to learn, but nothing that really effects driving it. Great sound system. Subaru is one of the last cars to offer a cd player, which is part of why I bought it."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"So far, very pleased.  Very positive handling.  We have the Touring model, so it requires some skill to complete all the programming.  It took a while to trust the lane centering, but it really does a great job, as does the adaptive cruise control.  I was a bit concerned about the power after reading some other reviews, but I can say that the vehicle's power is more than adequate.  Quality of build is absolutely superior.  Can't fine one flaw anywhere in the interior or exterior of the vehicle.  That's the quick review."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Traded in our 2016 Forester for the 2021 model and couldn’t be happier. Both models were the Premium line and there is so much more included in the 2021 over the 2016 that it is amazing. The ride is superior and so is the road noise (much quieter that is). Instrumentation and comfort is also much improved. So far couldn’t be happier. One thing to note is that because they put more into the car, you now have to purchase the cargo rails separately, but at $200 it was not the end of the world either."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I'm a 6'2"" man with an unusually long torso. Most new vehicles come with standard moon roof, and no height control in the passenger seat. This means I do not fit in most new vehicles without special orders. Some of the only vehicles I fit comfortably in, with the trim levels I want, are the Forester (taller headroom) and Outback (standard option to delete moon roof). Luckily I love these cars.

I have a 2021 Forester Premium with the power lift gate package, which adds rear cross traffic alert. The safety is fantastic. Subaru's adaptive cruise control can follow start and stop traffic, or intelligently slow down if the car ahead slows. It can also automatically steer and change lanes, although the system requires a good amount of input. It cannot follow hard corners for instance. Android Auto means I can use my phone's Google Maps for navigation. The tech is quite good even on less-than-loaded models. Overall I think the Premium pack with power lift gate is open of the better options on the market.

It has buttons! I hate the Tesla style over reliance on touchscreens. They get dirty, and they're dangerous to use while driving. The Forester Premium has all the right controls (volume, climate) on physical buttons. Once you commit those controls to muscle memory it's a superior experience.

The engine rocks. Reviewers complain that the engine is smaller in class, while praising best in class fuel efficiency. The two are related. The Forester has similar EPA gas mileage to my old Civic (!), and feels if anything faster. It corners like a dream. My wife is not a performance driver and she is still commenting on the lack of body roll. The Forester comes standard with a CVT which maximizes fuel efficiency. Drivers used to harsh manual transmissions often feel CVTs are weaker because they don't jerk as much. Think of the Subaru boxer engine more like a luxury experience - the power delivery is immediately and smooth at all speeds. I spend 1/3 the amount on gas that my family spend for their Land Cruiser, yet this thing can probably race my old Civic, with similar gas mileage. It's insane.

It is also a Subaru in all the right ways. Tons of storage. I packed for 2 people for a week going cross country, and barely even used the back seat. We arrived at a muddy back road and engaged the X-Mode just for fun. The vehicle had zero issues and I arrived with more energy thanks to the excellent safety features and adaptive cruise control. Equally capable rock climbing as at highway speed.

Complaints? The ride is quite stiff. It feels fine on the highway, but over poorly maintained city streets where truckers have built up brake zone ruts it's like a roller coaster. The infotainment system could be faster and integrate more seamlessly with Android Auto. When I plug in my phone I want Google Maps - make it happen. The steering assist is a bit annoying. It requires such constant input that I don't feel I'm gaining much. However, up models (especially on the Outback) have even more advanced navigation that likely makes this better. The stop-start cruise control with engine cutoff for efficiency is still a winner, it's just not a Tesla autopilot. Storage could be better. The cup holders are far back to put the X-Mode button on display, and the console has fairly small bins, so you're often hunting for a spot to put things. It's not terrible, but you get the feeling if they relocated the X-Mode button you could gain the storage you need. Rear headroom is poor with the moon roof, so rear comfort is a bit of a budget experience compared to the front. Interior is worlds better than the last generation Subaru, but they still need a design expert to to get rid of those last vestiges of awful cheap plastic where your hands go (especially around the door handle, and around the shifter, for me personally).

Overall. Zero issues after a six-hour trip into mountains and dirt roads and mud. Dealership experience was ideal. Fuel consumption is beautiful. Subaru cruise control means you arrive at your destination fresher. Covid financing and warranty options mean I'll be seeing my dealer if anything happens, and right now that seems wonderful. This car makes me and my wife happy. We literally drove it from the lot to a bike shop. Subaru lifestyle is real."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"For me, an SUV needs to have plenty of well-arranged space, a quiet and smooth ride, safety features, reliability and decent gas mileage. The 2021 Forester checks all the boxes. The Subaru Eye Sight system has to be one of the industry leaders, and has been improved even since my 2019 Subaru. I suspect some might feel that the car is under-powered, but merging onto the interstate is no problem, the fuel economy is much better than with a V6, and thi is an SUV, not a sports car"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"What a difference three years makes ! The 2021 Forester’s head and shoulders better than its’ predecessor. Proximity key makes for easy access. With key on your person, put your hand in the handle, and the car unlocks ( done from the passenger side, unlocks all doors !). Rear hatch opens seamlessly, faster than the previous model, also has heavier duty struts. Once the hatch is open, there is now a second button that closes and locks all the doors. Interior is rugged, especially the tailgate area being covered with rubber.  Eyesight’s better than ever, but, lane centering option is very jerky. Another nuisance is having to turn off the engine shutdown feature, otherwise at each stop and resuming driving sequence, the engine restart is noticeable, but not to the point it jerks you around. Infotainment and Starlink are also upgraded. With the My Subaru app, you can start the car remotely, also being able set temperature and other settings."
forester,4 out of 5 stars,"I pretty much like this car. A couple of things that are irritating is the cup holder. It's too far back to easily get a bottle of water or cup, takes a bit of manipulating to get it in your hand. The seat belt clasp is much too close to the seat, it digs into my hip, and I'm not a heavy person. I stuck a wadded up rag between the seat and the clasp, it kind of works. Have to turn off the button that makes the car stop/turn on when you stop, and turned off the steering that helps keep you in-between lines, I felt I was fighting the steering wheel all the time. But most of all it seems the brakes sticks when in slow traffic, I lift my foot and it's still slowing then it releases and kind of surges a bit."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I am absolutely in love with my 21 Forester Sport after 1 month and 900miles, it brings a smile to my face every time I drive it. I disagree with what is said in this review. I have been a die hard Toyota fan and a sports car guy, once I started to have a family I needed a change, and I couldn't be more impressed. This SUV accelerates and handles well. Is it going to throw you back? No, but what do you expect from a 4cyl N/A motor? I'd take it over a 4cyl Camry any day and I honestly have almost as much fun driving it as some of my previous sports cars, and it sticks in the corners on twisty, back roads."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"After years of Hondas and Toyotas and the poor treatment from the Toyota Dealership where I had purchased 7 Toyotas it was time to find different. During the pandemic I had lots of time to do online research and narrowed my choice to the Ford Bronco Sport or the Subaru Forester. The test drive and the style made the Forester my choice. We had two Toyotas to trade, A 2015 and a 2016 as it was time to go to one vehicle. The local Subaru dealer gave us $29,000 for the Toyotas and took $4,000 off the MSRP of the 2021 Forester Touring plus the 0% financing for 36 months made a great deal. The ride is great, the boxer engine is smoother than any V-8 we have owned also no torque steer when you accelerate. Visibility is very good and this is the first vehicle we have owned that I can see the end of the hood in many years. Very easy to get in or out of and the seats are great. The auto start/stop of the engine is annoying.`"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"This is my second Forrester, following my original first Subaru which was an Outback and a 2017 Forrester  - the Forrester’s windows’ visibility range is my favorite feature, and its handling of corners and curves In the toughest weather is the best!  Subaru’s mechanical reliability over years of ownership has been outstanding as has their Service Dept. team.  Safety features and interior comfort are wonderful - I love my Subarus!"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,I have one issue. It wants to be the boss of me. I object to the can telling me to keep my eyes on the road. I need to disable that feature. Otherwise I have no issues yet.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,We are very happy with our purchase. It has great safety and comfort features that we were looking for. Consumer Reports rates it as the best overall compact SUV.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Nice, Spacious, good handling and comfortable ride."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"This car is not a high performance vehicle and won't impress your friends at the country club but it will be safe, reliable, comfortable, efficient and cost effective. I had a 2019 and when I had the chance to trade up a couple of model years I didn't hesitate. I bought exactly the same model and build out as my original Forester. Because I liked it so much. My local dealer has a great reputation for service. The cargo space of the Forester is huge once you fold done the back seats. The eyesight feature enhances safety and the overall fit and finish is better than some of the German luxury cars I've owned in the past. If you are rational and logical and not looking for a status symbol it would hard to go wrong with the Forester. Never had a problem on the 2019 and don't expect I will on the 2021. Just....happy."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,My girlfriend had a Subaru Forester and it went to the land Beyond and we had to replace it. We decided to stick with the new 2021 Foresters and we are very pleased. Obviously we had a lot of trouble due to microchip shortages and Coronavirus issues. But overall I'm sticking with Forrester for life.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I love my Forester, I bought the Touring trim, as I currently drive a Lexus ES 350, and am accustomed to quite a few amenities. This vehicle has everything my Lexus has and more."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,I always stayed with Lexus and Acura cars.This is my first Subaru Forester and so far I love the car. Over-all it drives vary nice and no complaints whatsoever.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,Worth the purchase. Great safety features without spending a lot for an suv
forester,5 out of 5 stars,This car has everything you could possibly want in a well appointed vehicle. It is by far my favorite vehicle I have ever driven. I look forward to many years of service with my Forester.
forester,4 out of 5 stars,"I’ve driven Mercedes-Benz sedans for most of the last 20 years and while my wife has owned SUVs most of the that time, I never really cared for them.  Lately I’ve had lower back problems and came to the simple realization that my wife’s car was much easier to get in and out of than my own.

I bought the base model 2021 Forester with the wheel package and while this is definitely no luxury car (not even close), it isn’t annoying or uncomfortable.  Everything about it is simply adequate.  It is smooth and quiet on the freeway, though wind noise intrudes above 80 MPH or on windy days.  It is adequately powerful, though not in any way fast.  It gets adequate fuel economy (30MPG at 80 MPH, though still breaking in and may improve).  It even handles adequately, with a safe and secure feeling, tight turning radius and only moderate body lean, though of course there is nothing sporty about the handling.

In short, this car is an appliance.  Like my washing machine or coffee maker, it goes about its business without any annoyances, and of course with it’s high seating position it is even easier to get in and out of than my wife’s Mercedes GLC300, let along the Mercedes E300 I traded for it.

Speaking of trade, my regular Mercedes dealer of the last 15 years also carries Subaru in the shop next door, so even with the pandemic and microchip shortage, they gave me the new car at a slight discount (everywhere else was marking up new AND used cars a few thousand dollars over sticker) and matched CARMAX’s very high trade-in value on my E300.  In the end, I ended up with an even trade for my 80,000 mile old 2018 E300 for a brand new Forester and just paid the tax.

Its no luxury car, but so far (1000 miles in one weekend) it is a smooth, comfortable and solid-feeling car that I expect to give me years of trouble-free driving."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,This is my second Forester and I'm lovin' it!  Visibility is the best.  Great handling on the road.  Takes corners on a dime.  Comfort and room abound!  We have more features this time around and it just adds to our pleasure driving and touring with this car!  I'm guessing I'll make a return in three years for yet another Forester.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Very attractive vehicle, excellent handling, our Foresters go everywhere in all weather conditions - especially snow that hobbles other vehicles. Rear automatic braking and rear cross traffic safety features, along with blind spot detection make this a much safer vehicle."
forester,4 out of 5 stars,"Just bought this car this week.  Very impressed-t is such a smooth ride, especially on rough farm backroads.  Much more comfortable than the 2017 ford edge titanium i traded in.  Engine has plenty of getup and go.  BIGGEST COMPLAINT:  the harmon carden stereo does not accept iphones.  I am now understanding it is owner by samsung and people with apple iphones are having a ton of problems with the music skipping and being very distorted.  I did not know this before i bought the car and i probably wouldnt have bought it because i am an apple person.  Apparently all of the updates to both phone and car are not fixing it. I read about problems since 2018.  Huge disappointment for such a great car."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Very practical and capable suv, a workhorse"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,Very surprised at the level of features and styling. First new car in 20 years and we made the right choice.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,The car is not as quiet as most new cars while driving it but it is very comfortable to ride in.
forester,4 out of 5 stars,It's a smooth ride with a lot of standard features and comes with AWD. Plus plenty of rear leg room. All and all a real good ride and ride
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"roomy, comfortable, tight turning radius. love this car"
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Have always had “other” vehicles and dedication to the brands.  Decided we wanted something with a track record that had high marks in safety and longevity on the road and everything pointed towards Subaru.  Dealership was AMAZING and helpful with narrowing down which model would best suit us and going over every single option and package in detail and even laying out all the pricing options in front of us so we could compare easily and consider which would work best for us.  Planet Subaru in Hanover, MA ... can’t say enough good about them!  Definitely the “un-dealership” that they touted... great experience any great product!"
forester,2 out of 5 stars,"3 Subarus in three years due to quality issues....this 2021 Forester, my sixth, has the worst ride quality ever...ok on highways,  but around town you're thrown all around. Road noise is terrible, on wet roads sounds like no insulation. 20019 Legacy had body assembly issues . Dealer ripped me off  $7500 trade difference on a 2020 Forester, So much for best trade-in value.2021 windshield broke. Dealer said call you insurance co. I got on customer service any finally got it replaced. Seems having a issue with windshields breaking."
forester,1 out of 5 stars,Positively hate the ESS. The car shakes and shudders every  time when stopped at the red light and shakes and shudders again when it restarts.Keep switching it off but  it goes back into that mode as soon as I turn it on.
forester,3 out of 5 stars,"2021 Forester Touring for about a week now.  First the positives.  The stereo system blows away the Bose I had in Acadia.  Very responsive steering.  Mileage good. Smooth ride.  Now negatives.  Gas tank access on passenger side.  If the car doesn't have ventilated seats then why the perforations in the seats?  Feel sorry for the kid who pukes and you have to clean out  the holes. Eventually the holes stretch and don't look good plus they fill up with dirt, dust, dead skin, food crumbs.  Take a look on youtube as to how to clean.  Hole by hole with a dental tool.  Subaru has a head up or head straight ahead system which is actually kinda cool BUT if they were so concerned about keeping your eyes on the road then why not a heads up display on the inside windshield?  Where I have the steering wheel it blocks a portion of the dash and I need to look down.  Then get a warning to keep my head up.  Overall a decent vehicle but seems like not much thought went into the design.  Give it 3.5 out of 5 stars as of today."
forester,2 out of 5 stars,"I got my Forester sport in June 2021. First impression was great. After using the car for a week I started noticing many quality issues:
1- Engine noise is not good
2- interior noise such as plastic cracking and stuff moving that you can't find
3- Mpg is never honest after driving for 4 months I only got 22MPG combined not even closed to what it was advertised for.
4- Some mechanical noise stuff moving outside the car under the engine when you drive on a rough dirt road.
5- Not comfortable driver seat. If drive for a long distance you will for sure get back pain from setting into that uncomfortable driver seat or the passenger seat.
6- Eyesight system is never good when you enter a tunnel or driving in the city. It immediately stop and you almost lose control of the vehicle. Almost got me in a deadly accident + Adaptive Cruse control will not detect car who just pulled in front of you and you will need to stay alert all the time.
7- Engine power is like dragging a dead body. All sound but no power 
8- Towing capacity is just 1500lb and you need to pay around 1k to install a good hitch that looks like a factory install and for what to add a bike rack!
9- Wind noise makes you feel that you are riding a bicycle
10- Sound system quality is bad 
11- water leaks inside the door panel after car watch which could damage your speakers.

Overall I wish I did some research and no got fooled by the look of the car.
It's very disappointing to see that Subaru being advertised as a luxury safe while in many areas they have failed. Quality control team can do better special on the interior noise and the engine HP maybe STI brand can put their hands on Forester and show us what the real Forester will look like."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,So far we love everything about this vehicle!
forester,2 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a brand new 2021 mid-level Forester and so far, have regretted the decision.  This car is clearly aimed at folks my age (mid 50's) who more than anything are considered ""immigrants to technology"" but now are driving a vehicle loaded with tech that borders more of an autonomous experience.  
I can't tell you how many times my poor dog has been nearly launched through the front windshield as the ""eyesight"" feature detects a car slowing/stopped in front of me and slams on the brakes.  So far, this has not happened on an icy road but when it does, we will end up either in the rear-end of the car in front of us or sliding into oncoming traffic.
During highway travel, the car takes over, (especially with the cruise control feature activated) slowing us down and correcting if I get too close to the fog lines.  
And God forbid you don't want to wear you seat belt or take it off too early, you're treated to the ascending warning chime which makes you want to poke out your eyeballs hoping it will stop. 
Too much happening on the dash as far as lights activating telling you something, taking your eyes off of the road.  
The tiny graphics imprinted on the steering wheel buttons are not good for those who we
glasses and have to look down at them for several seconds to see exactly which button they just pressed.  
Having recurring issues with the bluetooth system dropping calls.
If I can speak for those in my generation, this is just too much tech and too frustrating of a driving experience.  
The car is not a total loss, however-  I love the engine, full-time awd, and the spacious interior.  Another totally cool touch employed by Subaru is providing something the equivalent of after-market all weather mats for the front back and cargo area as standard."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,Very spacious and a smooth drive.
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Everything about this car is great! I love that I can see well out of all the windows and, when I can’t, the eyesight tells me who is in my blind spot. It makes me feel very safe."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"Roomy, responsive, great safety  features,quiet on the highway."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"SuriusXM and starling, cost monthly fees after free trial. Otherwise, I’m enjoying all the features on this car."
forester,3 out of 5 stars,"Rented for a week. The electronic features like the operation of the key FOB, climate controls, lane departure, cruise control, etc., were maddeningly difficult to figure out.  Ride was fairly smooth but with 1980's compact car levels of road and engine noise.  Acceleration was good.  

The only inexpensive small SUV I've rented that has had car like levels of ride comfort, interior noise and seat comfort is the Korean based Buick Encore. But it's a smaller vehicle than the Forester & Rav4."
forester,3 out of 5 stars,We just didn't like a feature about the car stops hen at stoplights or stop sign and it took some time to starts back up. All Subaru vehicles have this feature.
forester,3 out of 5 stars,"Not that impressed, suspension a bit soft and so many rattles. Three piece dash? Subaru scolded me for wanting the eyesight unit to be fixed because it rattles! I was pissed, they made me feel so small....Great Mpg at the cost of light weight. and squeaks? Also design of wheel arches with 18 rims looks cheap, off the ground with small wheels."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"After more than 30 years of driving on different car brands. Subaru Forester is the best of the best.
we are extremely  happy with everything they build in the car. except the start/Stop option. That is the only dislike and annoying figure that I have . -- Safety, comfort are Top notch --
I wish I know it long ago. Remember: No car is perfect. But this one is standing out as the best !.
I recommend:  Do a lot of test drives on others to compare with it. You will buy it .
Need not to word it long here.
I give it a 5 stars all across with a big thumb up .The best bang  for your bucks."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I love these new features like automatic lights on/off, auto high/low beam, steering response headlights, off-line warnings, auto dimming mirrors both inside and outside. Excellent visibility all around the car. All these features make it so easy and nice to drive."
forester,2 out of 5 stars,"Edmunds review is right on the mark. I had to sell due to the noise, power, and tech deficiencies at  3150 miles. Purchased a 2022 Hyundai  Santa Cruz :)
My 1st Subaru and I really thought I liked the 21 Forester Sport . The LED head/fog lights and  AWD are 5 stars ,Got a great deal on the Sport w/ power lift gate, premium sound and  0% financing.  I kayak and cycle , so there's lots of space for my gear inside.  I should have rented it 1st before purchasing. The BAD: The start/stop is random/annoying, MPG avg is 22, ride is stiff/bumpy but ok, engine/power/trans are ok, the premium stereo covers the noise, the 3 screens were cool at 1st but they are a distraction. Starlink, Eyesight seems to work ok. The tech stuff is just not put together well, too many buttons, distractions, and sometimes buggy. The manuals are a bit huge. The roof rack is a problem, the factory  rails/crossbars work with my kayaks but not my bikes. I purchased a Thule and Yakima roof rack for my bikes and they caused too much wind noise. So I had to return those. I found a Malone brand Roof Rack that attached to the roof rails and it hold my bikes with less wind noise. I have to remove the rack when I want to transport my kayaks. Washing is a chore because  mud and dirt get in between all 5 doors/seals/frame and it makes it harder to clean.  I think Subaru needs to refine the Forester design and improve the drivers experience. Overall it's  an OK vehicle. I guess I don't love the quirks of my ""Foz"". My pet's don't drive and it's not an option to turn it in to a dog house. I guess I'll have sell it soon."
forester,2 out of 5 stars,"I planned on buying a new 2022 Forester. But after test driving 2021 the engine is very underpowered, very noisy (I know it's a boxer engine), and leans too much going around corners. My wife has a CRV and it is much quieter, handles better and much more refined.  Also, Windshield cracking issues...I will give the Forester a plus for off road handling and that's it.  No thanks I will pass."
forester,1 out of 5 stars,"My work has been purchasing a fleet of these for our work cars. It’s the single worst car I have ever driven in my life. It not only goes no where when you put the foot down it’s a death trap. It decides to slam the breaks on for no reason, example man hole that was 20mm high from the road slams breaks on. It beeps at you constantly, don’t dare look out your side window it’ll tell you by beeping at you  

I would rather ride a unicycle at work than this POS"

forester,5 out of 5 stars,Rides smooth
forester,4 out of 5 stars,I am overall happy with my Forester. I bought the premium package but did not realize that the back up camera did not beep on the premium package. Salesman did not mention that. Rather disappointing but a very nice vehicle.
forester,2 out of 5 stars,The supposed safety features actually create too much distraction & the car insists on telling you how to drive…more distraction. I loved my 2018!!  This is a death trap!!
forester,5 out of 5 stars,loaded with safety features

forester,4 out of 5 stars,Our Subaru Forester touring edition is six months old to date it seems to be really solid dependable car seems a little basic for height and model in terms of comfort and quiet ride
forester,5 out of 5 stars,Great little car
forester,4 out of 5 stars,"Got over 35 mpg on last 400 plus mile trip on the 101 Loop highway with some back road gravel driving. Seats are uncomfortable for 6' 3"" 250lb guy or I would have given it 5 stars."
forester,5 out of 5 stars,"I've been driving since 1971 and this is my first SUV vehicle and the 2021 Subaru Forester in premium trim has that honor.  Delivered in October 2021 amid the chip shortage, we lucked out because the person above us on the wait list declined when the vehicle arrived and with our choice of Jasper Green and Premium trim being the one that arrived, how could we refuse.  So far our ""Suba"" has not let us down, able to carry anything we have asked it to, including 5 cat cages!  The engine to us has given good response and decent mileage, considering our home area is traffic congested Honolulu.  So I can only imagine when folks on the ""mainland"" drive from state to state, maybe thats when people will appreciate more power, but to me the 2.5 engine is just fine.  Love the LED headlights, you will never want to go back to halogen after this!  Love the moonroof, AC vents for the rear passengers and having the rear seats recline is a bonus and the safety systems are top notch, especially the blind spot monitoring and rear traffic alert which added a power lift gate.  Wife and I are very pleased with our first Subaru!"
