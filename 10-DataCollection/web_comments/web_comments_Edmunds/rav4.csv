rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"We have purchased several Toyota's over the years. All of them have given us great service. Our latest a 2021 XLE has taken the shine off that impression. We hear whistling noises at highway speeds, the engine is much noisier then previous generation and the transmission is also not as enjoyable. Interior sort of jumps back to a more sterile and cheaper finish. I guess everything is still providing a decent experience just not what I have come to expect from past Toyota's."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I think they’re actually may be a safety issue with the 2021 RAV4, I have been trying to get in contact with Toyota and it’s almost impossible.

When I drive starting around 60 to 65 mph, the car gets really shaky and bumpy and feels unstable. I am now noticing this reflected in a few other reviews and I’m starting to think that there actually may be an issue with this exact model"
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Yesterday we took the RAV4 on a long distance drive to checkout the features. I like the road sign and lane sway warning feature however we observed the car was swaying and appeared to be difficult to control while traveling around 65-75 mph when LTA and Cruise Control were on. I did not use cruise control during the remainder of the trip.

This seems to be a known issue .. too bad we did not see this issue when we checked out the numerous video reviews on Youtube ......

rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I have owned so many cars in my lifetime but never a Toyota. I have bought used cars, cars that were just junk and I have bought new cars and most of them have let me down and failed prematurely. My background in the Military required an immense ability for attention to detail and trust me when I say that when something wasn't right with my vehicle, I knew it. Everything from the steering, to braking, to subtle noises and even distinctive smells that should not be coming from under my engine compartment that certainly hinted at trouble to come.
That being said, I can honestly say that I was thoroughly impressed with the workmanship and quality that was noticeable immediately when inspecting the exterior and interior of my new Rav4. You can feel it when you are driving in the response of the vehicle the way it handles, the way the steering feels in your hands and the purr of the motor you feel under your feet. You just get the sense that this car is going to last and is a worthy investment of safety and peace of mind. If you are considering a Rav4...don't even hesitate...go drive one and I am willing to bet, you will buy it. They are truly amazing vehicles."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,The 2021 Rav4 very bumpy and shaky when driving over 55mph. The stability on the hwy is so poor and dangerous.  Very disappointed with Toyota safety design
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I've always driven General Motors vehicles but in March 2021, I decided to give Toyota a chance after hearing wonderful things about the Rav4.  After having the car for less than one month, I was at a stop light - completely stopped - and my car lunged forward TWICE and hit the car in front of me.  While at the body shop, the technician was pulling the car around and had his foot on the brake and said the RMPs went up and the car lunged again.  I immediately reported it to Toyota after the first incident.  They sent someone to the body shop to perform diagnostic tests.  The test was completed on 4/14.  I reported the second incident on 4/27 (immediately after it was reported to me) and was told they could not do anything until the Toyota engineers review the diagnostic test data.  To sum it up, I have a brand new car that I have not driven since 4/1/21 because I do  not feel it is safe to drive.  Neither my salesman at Van York or Toyota have been of any assistance."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised by negative reviews of the 2021 RAV4.  I have had mine for a few months and have had no problems with it.  Often new cars have little issues at first, but this one has had none and I hope this continues.  I got the hybrid AWD model.  The gas mileage is amazing and it did really well in the snow.  Hopefully it continues to do well because I was planning to keep it for a very long time."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I love the easy ride and the power to go, go, go.  If I need to get on the freeway quickly, this car has the oomph to do it!  I love the color (silver) and all the bells and whistles.  I plan on keeping this car for a long time."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"We recently purchased a 2021 RAV4 XLE PREMIUM trim for my husband. This SUV is amazing and comfortable, as he is 5’11 and I am 5’9”. The 2.5L engine has a lot of pick me up when needed, which I don’t understand how some are saying this vehicle is underpowered, sure it’s no 8cylinder but it has more than sufficient power for everyday use. It’s very roomy, much more than my new 2021 NX 300 makes me like the RAV4 a little more since it’s also very reasonable in price with all the features it brings. We bought ours with just the features the XLE Premium has to offer with no extra add ons, since this is a commuter vehicle and my husband drives 92 miles a day round trip and a full tank of gas lasts a little over 4 days. That’s amazing for it being a gasoline engine and not a hybrid, which we tend to stay away from for now until that technology is a little more perfected. Overall I definitely recommend this trim level RAV4, oh and it’s assembled in Canada which I know from experience produces amazing quality Toyota models. Test drive one for yourself! We traded in our reliable 2017 Camry SE for this one and don’t regret it one bit! We are a Toyota family for life!!!! 

Update as of 10/05/2021 - We are still in love with our RAV4 and it’s been very reliable after 12,000 miles. Only been at Toyota for regular service and get its oil changed every 5k instead of the 10k for extra protection to the engine. I still highly recommend this vehicle for anyone in the market for a reliable and spacious SUV that gets great gas mileage!"
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"Went on road trip, driving about 80 mph on highway. Big 18 wheeler goes by on right side fine.  A Ford pickup F150 goes by on right side I feel like I got sucked in. Was fighting driving the SUV all the way. And coming back a Mustang goes by on right and the same. Held real tight to the steering wheel and I felt that it was all over the road too. Engine is loud too.  Has anyone else feel this way?  I read some reviews and can't find them.  Getting it checked..."
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"I hate the sound this years Rav makes when it first excels. It sounds like a truck straining. I loved my other 2 Ravs , neither sounded like this. I wish it was quieter.  Once in an SUV , I don’t want to go back to a car. I hope they change the way it sounds when you start off. My husband also finds it’s tight getting in passenger side without hitting your head ."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"I bought this car for my wife. She drove it 2 months and gave it to me. I have driven it for 2 years and I want to give it back to her. Let me tell you the good things first. It’s reliable because it’s a Toyota. It averages 27mpg. Cargo space is useful. It’s cool looking. It’s easy to park. Acceleration is impressive for such a small engine. The bad- cabin is small and cramped. I hit my head when climbing in. The door sill is raised and I catch my foot on it exiting vehicle. Wife doesn’t have a flat surface to place purse on. Doors have no grab point to hold onto and avoid bashing car door on neighbors car you park next to. Interior lighting is poor, can’t see fuel door release in the dark. Engine sounds like a wheat thrasher about to explode under hard acceleration. Car is jittery on the highway and dances in the lane. Very difficult to keep it steering in a straight line without correcting constantly. Low pressure tire light comes on but fails to indicate which tire might be low. Does not have any way to monitor mileage for next service due. SImply comes on when due. Car has various annoying rattles. As soon as the new Frontier arrives, this car will be someone else’s baby. NO GIVEBACKS!"
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Pro:
*Fantastic new D4S generation of engine.
*Attractive exterior styling.
*Updated interior ergonomic and technology.
*Same useful utility. 

Cons:
-Vague steering.  In fact its night and day worse compare to the previous generation of 2018.
-Inferior lumbar support on drivers seat which is painfully noticeable on long trips."
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,I have just purchased a 2021 Toyota Rav 4 Hybrid and am impressed by the fit and finish.. But that's the end of it... The road noise is way beyond acceptable.I wear hearing aids and have to remove them when driving just to make the noise more bearable.. I recently owned a Ford Edge and it was completely sound proof and a pleasure to drive... This vehicle is going up for sale after just 300 kms of driving... I can't live with this noise any longer... Toyota should know better and should spend some dollars on sound proofing this vehicle ...
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I'm 62 years old and this was to be my retirement vehicle. I used to be a toyota loyalist. Although I have been driving a buick for 10 years. Had a 2003 Rav4. Drove it for 8 years until totaled in accident. I guess I'm too old now.  Decided to be economical and buy the New Rav4. Wrong. Way too much noise. Road and wind noise.  Engine noise is awful. Steering bad. Never had issues with cloth seats before. This model is terrible.  Soils so easily. Just touch it with anything. Then when I try to clean it.  It makes water rings. The seats are hard and thin and uncomfortable.  My husband complained about lighting. He's correct. Awful. Very little wimpy interior lights.  WHY ?  And back to seats. No height adjustment for passenger seat! Really they couldn't put the little hand crank to raise or lower.  The sun visors are too small and without raising the seat everytime you are blinded. Everything is hard plastic touches. No comfort.  To use the buttons on lower left you have to twist and lower your head. Not good. Back doors do not open far enough. Other small suvs open all the way out. The touch screen is horrible to look at. Faded and harsh. Looks like terrible TV picture.  The radio speakers not good. Cheap sounding. Not clear. Toyota has the levels and packages crazy on this. To get the better features it is way pricey. You can go ahead and get a midsize suv. Which is exactly what I did. But couldn't get Toyota sadly. Way too pricey. Sadly had to get another foreign maker.  Midsize with luxury features. But all the sharp sporty looks. The new 2021 Kia Sorento. LOVE! 
The Rav4 is sharp looking but it ends there. Just my opinion. I really hate it. I wanted to love it! 
Transmission jerks all the time. Stop start jerks....the cluster gauge is tiny. Hard to read so much on there! Try other comparable vehicles. Lost money because we had to get rid of it"
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"i am surprise at negitive reviews, I am happy with my rav4.  It gets great gas mileage, I am getting 30 mpg combined and after breakin I am expecting alittle better.   I do agree the seats are firm but I have had back surgery and it really isnt a problem for me.  I find the cabin to be super quiet and I do not hear engine noise on the highway.  It is a small suv and I do not expect a Lexus performance.  I am happy with my purchase.  I owned a CRV and had issues with it.  I am hoping that toyota comes through for me with a great reliable suv."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I have had this RAV4 for a year now.  It is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  This RAV4 replaced a 2010 CRV EXL that I had for over 10 years.  It was a great, reliable vehicle, but this RAV4 way out performs the CRV.  But then this is newer technology also.  The RAV4 has more power, smoother ride with the 2.5L 4 cyl with the 8 speed auto trans (a great combination).  I get great gas mileage, between 33 and 34 mpg on the highway, and between 28 to 29 around town.  I love the AWD and the 19"" wheels.  Being this is my first new vehicle in over 10 years, I love all the new technology and safety features that my old vehicle did not have.  You can get a laundry list of all the great features it has on the Toyota site, so no need to list them all here.  I realize that many new vehicles have similar new technology and safety features, but I really like the styling of the RAV4 and Toyota's reputation of quality and reliability.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this vehicle.  Being in the Detroit area, I am criticized for not buying one the 'Big 3' vehicles, but I don't work for them, and their quality and reliability can't compare to Toyota as far as I am concerned.  I will put far less money into maintenance with the Toyota and it will last far longer.  You cannot go wrong with this vehicle."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I completed considerable research prior to my purchase. I test drove the competitors. The Rav4 has the most horsepower (eliminating troublesome turbo options of other makes), best gas mileage, best clearance, most cargo space and the most reliable engines. The ride is smooth and quiet, acceleration is eager and responsive , great visibility, nice large touch screen and plenty of head and elbow room. I have not experienced any steering or road noise issues mentioned in other reviews. I do agree the lumbar support could be improved (but I could say the same for the competition). It's also the best looking SUV out there, IMHO. There is definitely a reason this SUV is the top seller in it's category, even though it's not the cheapest. I bought my Rav4 in April 2021 and I am super happy with my decision."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,The 2021 Rav4 is still leaking roof rail. It had bad gaskets on the roof rail bolts.
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Smooth Ride, Decent acceleration, Relatively quiet highway driving, Good fit and finish, (finally) power seat on XLE model, Apple Car Play, comfortable seats.
Cons: Quirky 8 Speed transmission has trouble finding gear at slow speeds, minor occasional lurch in first gear from stop, noisy engine permeates cabin in city driving, RAV4 not quite as nice as 2018 and under years. Mazda CX-5 better vehicle. [non-permissible content removed]."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Pros: good gas mileage, dependable.  Cons: cheap interior rattles all the time, door color and dash color do not match, door controls are poorly positioned, door handle is not positioned well, underpowered, Android Auto/Apple car play has to be plugged in with wire while competitors offer wireless, lighting in the trunk area is non existent, lighting for center console does not point and the buttons are not lit so you do not know what you are pressing overhead, loud squeeling sounds come from engine compartment in reverse and when you are sitting still. I wish I had done more research before purchasing. I have previously owned 2 other Rav4s and they were built much better."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"OK, just test drive a Toyota RAV4 mid-size or base version. Their interior is poor, below industry standard, seats uncomfortable and even front windows shudder when powered up/down. 
Toyota is the cheapest car company. Their arrogance on reliability has completely destroyed the fine design, completely disregarded consumer expectations of this 21st century! You don't have to believe my review. Just sit in RAV4 and you will see what I am stating here.
The entire top Management of Toyota needs to be fired. Just sit inside Honda CRV, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Outback etc. And then compare to the cheapest, rudest experience at $30-35K price level you get from Toyota."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,Vehicle is too lite for snow covered roads.  Looks nice but too many low price parts result in noisy ride and low quality feel.  The added safety features are nice but actual feel and ride are not impressive.  I would rate the feel and ride at 1 star.  Based on this over priced vehicle I would not recommend it over other market AWD.
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"I consider myself a Toyota client.  I have been driving Toyotas for years.  I have had a Yaris, Camry, and 2-previous RAV4.  Great decision on those previous cars, but with 2021 LE TAV4 it has been my worst decision on cars ever.
Exteriors look nice like all models.  Drivers chair VERY uncomfortable.  Motor VERY noisy, and you hear the car doing a lot of effort.  The actual car inside it is very noisy you don't have complete silence inside.  Speakers sound not good either. I hate driving this RAV4.  If you have this car in mind consider your decision this is a car and now I'm stuck until this lease is over."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,2021 Toyota RAV4 is meeting and exceeding all our expectations. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV of this size. It’s very versatile and comfortable. The Toyota app and Android Auto are fantastic tools.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"We love this vehicle. We had an older 2012 Rav4 and liked it, but this one has so many improvements. Much better 4 wheel drive, more power. We highly recommend it."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"We have only had the car a couple of weeks but drove it 1500 miles across the western US. It performed perfectly and was both comfortable and well equipped. The gas mileage did however average only 27 MPG with only two adult passengers and a moderate amount of luggage, but that is likely because we were consistently driving at highway speeds across expanses of desert.  Very pleased so far, though early days."
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"Rented a RAV4 XLE AWD while visiting my sister. Found the vehicle to be comfortable, with excellent seating position, much better than my current car. Excellent visibility and lane changing alert worked well. Engine somewhat underpowered from stop, but gets up to speed quickly. 
I own a Subaru Outback, and the RAV4 definitely has a more truck like feel. Not that it’s bad, just different. A bit of road noise at highway speed and a whine at acceleration which should have been engineered better. 
“A” pillar does lean back a bit low, so definitely a consideration if you are taller to get in and out of vehicle. Interior door handle is close to hinge, as others noted, but didnt really have any difficulty with its use. Radio intuitive, actually simple. Loved “Car Play” which displayed my phone’s GPS on screen. 
Overall a solid vehicle, with minimal complaint."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"Great suv love every aspect, mine is a 2021 i don't have battery or gas tank issues. One thing about buying new cars stay away the first 2 years or production take goes on any car. Only wish they had 4x4 instead of AWD."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"I have a new 2021 Rav4 XLE Premium. When I release the brake the vehicle stumbles or jerks or lurches, whichever term you prefer. I have just over 1,000 kms on it and my service manager says that there is no software or mechanical fix for the issue."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,I had a 2017 Toyota Camry but wanted something bigger. I wanted to love the RAV4 but was disappointed in the power. It felt like it was struggling to get up to speed and to maintain. Unfortunately all of the RAV4s have the same engine too which is disappointing with No option to upgrade. I would much rather get a little less gas mileage and get more horse power to make it feel adequate. I ended up going with a used 2018 V6 Tacoma.  The 4 cylinder Tacoma was underpowered too. I did like everything else about the Rav4 from test driving.  Hope this helps anyone in the market.
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"A new 2021 RAV4 XLE (gas) is sitting in my garage. It seem nice. Doors could shut easier. There is a tendancy for them to reman open a crack if you don't push hard to shut. The gas mileage is short of the published numbers, and the tank is small (14.5 gallons, which is the redesigned tank for the hybrid version). There is a full size 12v battery, so therre should be enough juice to power the various options and accessoriers without going dead overnight. The car hopefully has the service fix for that issue experienced with the 2020s.  It's a lot of car for the money. Buyers should do their research to know what to expect."
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"Door handle on the inside is too close to the door hinge, make it very hard to close. 
Lack of power and seat comfort. Rear tail gate hinges are made of very cheap material appears to be cracking after 1 year. 
The only thing I like about it is the modern interior design. 
The Subaru, Santa Fe and the Sorenta are better design and value."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"Gas in oil crankcase, loud road noise, rear seats don't fold flat, under powered, not happy with my 2021 toyota rav4..."
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"I got the XLE hybrid for my wife who was set on this car. I would not have bought this. This is a very nice looking car but it lacks in almost every way compared to my 15 year old Audi.

The road noise is bad. Like really bad. It is as if somebody has a hair dryer on in the back.

The road noise cannot be even mitigated with music because the speakers are of very poor quality. The music is not crisp at all. I have never heard such low quality sound in a car. Its comparable to listening on the speaker of your phone.

Speaking of phones and music. That is the only way to get music into the car. There is no CD player. There is no auxiliary audio in. You have to do everything through your phone. This is not the terrible but it is super annoying and limiting. Just another cheap out from Toyota.

In terms of driving it does not handle well. I likely should have gone for the XSE which has higher end suspension in it. The XLE sways around corners and generally feels like it needs new shocks. 

The view is not great either. They compensate for it by having a ton on sensors but it would just be better if the layout was designed properly.

In summary this is not really a high end SUV. This is a soccer mom car for getting groceries not for ski trips. Generally feels cheap."
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"'21 RAV4 base line is hum drum.  Whiny engine (underpowered) and aside from std safety items, isn't nicely equipped.  The Limited trim, on the other hand is nicely equipped but way too expensive.  However, balancing options and staying out of the luxury brands, the Limited is a good balance on options and price.  Very well equipped (a/c vented front seats, pano moonroof, 360 birds eye camera system,...) Limited priced at $36K ($4k under MSRP).  Gas mileage is a joke!  RAV4 window sticker says 33mpg on the highway...  we average 22-24mpg...  Honda CRV does get 29-31...  As for driving experience, the struts on RAV4 is stiffer than CRV, but all round driving is sub par to CRV.  Lane assist operates sometimes well, but on the honda, works great.  Auto tailgate works sometimes...  adaptive cruise sometimes...  Yes, all round the Honda wins...  but if you drive a lot and really need vented front seats, the RAV4 is the only model with it.  RDX ASPEC and Advanced ($47K) has it..."
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"Stay clear of the entry models. Tire noise is terribly loud (while there isn't much wind noise, the sound of the tires rolling is overpowering). The ride is quite harsh and the suspension doesn't do a good job of soaking up bumps.

The seating position is also not good. You feel like you're almost touching the ground and the dashboard is very high (not ideal for shorter drivers, I am not short and it was bothersome for me). 

For upper trim levels, the interiors are much better in terms of features and fit and finish, but the ride quality and poor seating position still exists. Toyota needs to step up their game. Sure, these are reliable, but that's all the Rav has going for it. There are so many vehicles that are competing in this class and many of them ride better and are feel more premium (Nissan, Mazda, Honda and Hyundai just to name a few). I would definitely check out the competing vehicles in this class before choosing a Rav 4."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I just drove a rented RAV4 3000 miles and I am exhausted.  After reading other reviews I understand why.  It is the automated lane assist that is on with cruise.  Many times as the white line peeled off to the right for an exit it felt like the tires were grabbing a tar line.  The first couple if times it took my breath away.  At 70 MPH in the rain it was spooky.  No thanks Toyota, I'll drive the car myself."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Small cramped interior, loose steering , small seats, rides a bit stiff. Door handle awkward. Poor interior layout and I'm not usually picky. Head hits roof on way into seat I'm only 5'8"
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased a 2021 Rav4 LE AWD. There seems to be so many shortcomings in the interior design. The interior light is terribly positioned and shines directly in your eves. They do not point down, but to the side. This leaves anything you want to see in your centre console area impossible, unless you open your vanity lights. The shifter feels like it's too far to the right. Everytime I go to turn up the radio, I grab for the fan dial instead. And the position of the handle on the doors is awkward. Over half of the time leave you with a door that is not fully closed. It feels like you need to use the force of slamming your door just to have it shup properly.  The rear interior light is terribly positioned as well. It is right above the back rest part of the rear seats. This leaves the back seat feet area dark as well at the trunk. I feel like I need to have aftermarket interior lights installed!"
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"extremely uncomfortable interior, loud, terribly sounding engine, no headroom, hard, small seat cushions. Small trunk. Ok JBL sound system. Wish I purchased camry v6."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I have bought Rav 4's, exclusively and they have all been amazing.  My fist had 90,000 miles on and was ten years old.   Then, 2011, 2015 and now 2021.   I've had no regrets."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,Bought a Rav4 xle 2021. Was told it had a navigation system that work without phone. It appears to be untrue.  Get everything in wrting. Frustrated. Otherwise love it!
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,I have had no stability problems with my 2021 Rav4.  Did the people that have consider the smoothness of the road they were on?  I have had mine up to 70 plus mph with no problems.  It rides well better than the 2011 i drove for 10 years.  I hope this one gives me the service that 2011 did.  These are fine cars and there are people that would complain even if you gave them a million dollars. Take all reviews with a grain of salt even this one if you must.
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"good car for the price. Like the interior styling better than how a sister....BUT....hate the fact that Toyota for 10 years can't design a simple oil filter canister like all other car brands....they have this stupid canister, drain plug, double oil ring design that sucks. Get with the 21st century Toyota"
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Great vehicle that has style and class and won’t break the bank.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"Love my Rav4….Smooth ride, lots of room, great safety features!"
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Excellent SUV. I liked. It is with all the powers. I like the security features. Cabin it's silent. Very comfortable. Smooth on the road. Great interiors and space.
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,So i just bought a 2021 RAV 4 LE Wjich was not what i wanted but hey i needed a car had it for 2 weeks brand new i mind you and the car started acking crazy with my kids in it nearly causing an accident i could have hard control it they were screaming and saying get me out this car so now the engin light is on so i had to drive soslow to the dealer and it was far i got their left the car then got word they dont know what the issues is but they are still running test i saved all my money for this car cause i have sick kids and now im with outh the new one got a car note to pay on the new car i cant drive and they given me a rental Toyota is a billion dollar company if something is unsafe and now working replace it in these to.es its gard to come by money and now all what i save is in an undrivable car stuck at the shop
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Wonderful car with comfort and style not to mention room and great gas mileage.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I love my 2021 Toyota XLE , it handles well , I used the snow traction button tonight due to unexpected snow accumulation, it had great traction ! I like  the spaciousness and style of vehicle ! The radio sound is great . I like the fact it tells you how many miles are left to go until you need to fill car up !"
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I have always owned and favored Toyota’s and Honda’s. Recently my family has had many issues with their newer model Honda’s and now Toyota seems to be lacking as well. At 3,423 miles my transmission went out in my new 2021 Rav 4. While stranded in dangerous Atlanta traffic I realized that I can no longer trust Toyota. They don’t make them like they used too! Being a mechanic for 25 plus years I would recommend staying with Japanese car manufacturers for daily drivers, but not Toyota or Honda. Do yourself a favor and buy a Mazda or Subaru. After my warranty covered the cost to replace my transmission I traded the Rav 4 in for a Subaru Crosstrek sport and I love it. It will live much longer and has great AWD capabilities. My brother has also had 10 plus years of hassle free satisfaction out of his Mazda’s. Maybe I will try Toyota again in the late future."
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"Hired the Hybrid and was looking forward to it.

Economy was 6 litres/100Km on mostly country driving.  Not good as my 2.0 litre 2005 BMW gets the same and does not need a battery that will need replacing at a sizeable cost.

Dynamics were ok for an entry level car.  The ABS did not do very well when stopping on dirt roads.  The traction control was worse.  If you accelerated too hard, the back swung out to the side.  Possibly it is an early (and cheaper) generation traction control unit.  Latest generation traction control and ABS measure wheel slip many times a second and hence the wheel does not noticeably slip as it slipping is stopped just as it starts.  The Toyota seemed to have a less sophisticated control unit as the wheels spun, stopped spinning, spun again, stopped spinning and spun again, which is why the rear end slid out sideways.  May work better on smooth bitumen?

Comfort was good in the front seats.  I can see people taking a test drive and being impressed.  The road noise while on a highway in the back was quite high as there is little sound insulation for the rear passengers  and the boot has places with no sound insulation at all.  To speak to the rear passengers needed us in the front to raise our voices so much that it was better to speak when in towns with slower road speed. The windows did not stop the sun burning through onto your arm. More advanced cars use different glass that looks the same but stops most of the heat getting through so passengers are more comfortable, the aircon does not need to work as hard, etc.

Safety.  The self steering was ok so long as there were well painted lines on both sides of the road such as a major multi lane highway.  On good country roads, it would it was unable to detect the left side white line unless it was new and well painted.  Roads where the left edge was less defined such as parts missing or a section was damaged where a truck ran wide in the past etc., meant the car would continue to slowly veer off the road.  So.  Ok for good highways, not for driving on the usual country roads.  Passing other cars was a bit slow.  I know that electric motors can provide enormous power short short times such as say 10 seconds (I am engineer).  Not sure why Toyota did not let the battery give the motor more power so overtaking would be safer?

Sophistication was low.  The touch panel was not intuitive to use.  If you walk up to the car and unlock it with the key fob, the windows will not wind down so you can let the car cool down before driving off.  You have to put the key fob in the centre console and push the start button.  This means there are no smarts in the electricals, it's just a wire to the switch and battery.  By comparison, in a 16 year old 3 series BMW, you can use the key fob to unlock and wind down the windows as you walk up.  No need to get in a hot car.  This is because the windows, etc., are all smart and under the control of the car's computer which does what you want when you press the fob buttons, such as just open the drivers door, or open all doors, or wind up all windows and close the sunroof as you hold the ""lock car"" button.

Overall a basic unsophisticated car.  Quite good and a cheap price (around $48K), hence maybe you cannot expect the latest (or expect a 2005 level of sophistication) such as high quality ABS and traction control, a quiet ride in the back and creature comforts."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,I didn't buy it
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,Love Toyota connect
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"I rented a 2021 Rav4 this past weekend to visit my daughter who owns a 2017 Rav4. The legroom on the 2021's passenger side was bad. The legroom on my daughters Rav4 was 1 or 2 inches better. The 2021's engine shutdown feature when you stop sounded like the engine had bad motor mounts, if it was my car I'd be taking it to the dealer. Even my daughter thought the 2021 looked cheap. I'd steer clear of this model."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Very Pleased with the purchase of this 2021 Rav4 XLE. Nice looking with great features!
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,There’s no any towing hook in front and back of the vehicle
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Nice car lots of getup for a 4 cycle
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,It’s integrated with your IPhone.
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"Too truckish to be a Camry Station Wagon.  Much more road noise than a Camry. Road bumps more jolting. More road vibration in the steering wheel. Highway directional stability not as good.  Upper door panels hard plastic even on the XLE. Despite these lack of Camry like characteristics and refinements, I found the Rav4 competitive with a Subaru Forester I rented.  

I believe shoppers looking for a medium sized SUV with Camry levels of quietness and ride comfort and seat comfort should look at the Toyota Venza which has great user reviews."
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"It’s a great car. It’s good on gas and all it’s features are pretty up to date with competitors. The entune can be annoying at times but I use CarPlay so it doesn’t bother me. The engine is very loud, a common Toyota thing, so it feels pretty rugged when driving which can be good and bad. There is quite a bit of road noise but most cars have that. All around great reliable and safe car, as Toyota’s always are."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I love my rav4xle it’s fast, spacious and good on gas mileage."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"RAV4 TRD Off Road.  Best car I've ever owned.  Great mileage, super handling and comfortable on the open road.  In town turning and parking a dream.  Just a great all around vehicle. Capable of more then I use it for.  Nice to know its there if I need it.  Don't need a ""rock crawler""."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"I trade my 2021 rav4, at first 4 months you feel it comfortable, but you get through more it get rough, my wife got dizzy in front passenger, and my kids complain at the back, (im drove by the limit) the braking system was getting hard even i press gently, the price was not match to what you paying for, ive been in toyota for my 2 car, now im enjoying another japanese brand, hohohoo"
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"Without car play.The trunk does not open from the car.Poor interior of the car, there is no way to control the phone from the steering wheel"
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"It’s my second RAV4, loved my 2006, it was almost 300,000 miles, it was faithful."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"I would highly recommend this car, if you get it blacked out it is very sexy and drives very smoothly. The sound system is good and the back up camera is very useful. If you’re on the fence- get one!"
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,I recommend this adorable car. I am also satisfied with a good customer service of the dealer and the seller.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Great HWY and City gas mileage...seeing 32 city and 36 HWY!  Plenty of room!!!  Bigger than previous models. Plenty of power.  Get the faux leather seats on the XLE Premium - def worth it!    Great on road trips and tailgating.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,So far there is nothing I dislike about it.  I can't imagine that anything is missing from it
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,I’ve had 3 Rav 4 2021 the first 2 had problems with transmission if I’m stopped put on the gas quickly I go nowhere it goes nowhere now I have my third car snd today at a stop sign when I left the stop sign to go into another road it cut out on me and went nowhere very upset and it’s very dangerous
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Beautiful drive and comfortable
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"- Fuel consumption issue didn’t meet advertised fuel consumption rating; poor gas tank design
- Poor handling; read the moose test
- Poor sound insulation; very noisy ride that even loud music can’t fixed
- Expensive for what you get; go read consumer reports to see why it’s ranked lower than a cheaper Tuscan
- subjective, but it’s ugly as sin with interiors that look like something from the 90s
- don’t buy this; my experience been nothing but regret only bought because so many praise Toyota but I think they’re just coasting off their antique reputation"
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,As a senior citizen the electronic are too confusing
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,I haven't used it alot yet but satisfied with it.the only cons is that It does not have remote start function
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,I had a 2018 Rav4 and other earlier years that I loved. Perfect size and handled nice. Not liking the changes in the 2021. Why do they keep making it bigger ?! I liked the Rav for its smaller size but still being a SUV. Do not like the longer length at all. Also does not handle as well as the 2018. Think ill be looking for something new ( not Toyota) for my next SUV.
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,The Rav4 is an excellent SUV. Whats not to like? Great engine a non-turbo long lasting reliable AWD vehicle.  Nice interior more space than the Venza.
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,Love the car but engine is slow on acceleration. Would be nice if they offered nor V6 options.
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"The Rav4 is good looking car with ample room and drivability. We had the Limited Trim, which was fully loaded including the Advanced Technology package. Ours was not a hybrid and gas mileage for in-town use was a bit disappointing at 23.5 MPG. When accelerating, the engine was a bit noisy and the wind noise was pretty loud. Understand that we also have a 2021 Venza which is quieter, more luxurious, and gets 39 MPG without blinking an eye. In direct comparison, the RAV4 falls short. Both vehicles are the highest trim and are only about $2500 apart in MSRP."
rav4,3 out of 5 stars,"We rented one of these for two weeks when a vehicle was in the shop. We got the AWD because we live in Alaska and this is an AWD SUV, right? We’ve owned Toyotas for years and figured no issues.
Wrong.
We got about 10” of snow one night and this vehicle could not get out of the driveway. It got stuck in the snow in the driveway.
Several issues:
1. AWD is decent for driving down the road in some inclement weather. it is bad when stuck. 4WD would sent power to all 4 wheels. AWD varies the power by what the computer wants to do, not where I want the power to go. This is why it’s good to avoid AWD if you are going to need power to all 4 wheels irrespective of what the computer says.
2. The ground clearance on this is horrible for a vehicle that claims to be an SUV. I can understand if this were a commuter vehicle like a Camry or Maxima or Impala. But this just does not work.
3. The vehicle has NO tow bolts. So we are trying to find a place to attach the tow rope and there is no place to attach it. We wound up using part of the upper engine frame because we had nowhere else to attach the tow rope. And even then, the vehicle could not overcome the amount of snow.,

Takeaway: if you live in Arizona or Texas or Florida where you never get snow, this would likely work. Bit of rain, even torrential rain, and AWD will do you fine for the roads. But if you live in Alaska or Montana or Idaho or Maine where you can get snow, and I mean real snow, not just a dusting here and there, do yourself a favor. Just get a real 4WD SUV with some ground clearance, tow hooks in the front and back, and some decent tires. The time will come when you will thank me."
rav4,4 out of 5 stars,"In all the car has good look and technology, I have just drove it 1000 miles and here are some of the things I would love the Toyota has to improve. Driver and passenger door handles from inside are located in a place where it is hard to close especially for my wife, I have to pull it hard to get it close. Acceleration is good but not very good when you want to pass another vehicle while you are driving 55 - 65 mph even in sports mood.  
Fuel economy is not what I have expected it displays my average mpg 30-31 on console  but the actual mpg is lower around 22-26 combined. I drive it almost 40 miles a day that is 8 miles city and the rest is highway. All in all it seems a good car."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Like all Toyotas this vehicle is top-notch especially for the price
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Great fuel efficiency and amazing driving assistance technologies
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,Bought HNov. 21 to drive back and forth from AZ to see kids in Ca and save money on gas. Rides smooth at high speeds. Seats little hard so i put on a set of WET OKOLE neoprene seat covers which helped. No shaking or vibration issues. No rattling. Runs great.
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,I have a 2021 Rav 4 Hybrid with 6000 kilometers.  The battery has died two times already when the weather is below minus 10C. This is going to become a big problem with me. I recommend you consider this before you buy one. I hope they fix this problem soon
rav4,2 out of 5 stars,"The tailgate rattles like no SUV I’ve ever owned.  The car makes a sound when moving like a brake is locked up and dragging.  Took in twice now in the first year to find out why and the dealer says he can’t find the source of the noise, suggests I drive it until it breaks since there are 2 years left on the warranty.  Last Toyota for me."
rav4,1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my 2021 Toyota Rav4 new in August. The panels between the front and rear windows on both sides of my car are discolored and look like the plastic is melting. Magee Toyota in Hanover, MA replaced one side in January. Within a month both side panels discolored again right where the brackets are. I contacted Toyota and requested a meeting with a Toyota Service Department supervisor. They had a representative contact me, and I was told that the problem is Solar related and they will not help with the problem. I have a bumper to bumper warranty and the windows are between the bumpers, but they will do nothing."
rav4,5 out of 5 stars,"First, the fuel economy is great. Although it only has 205 HP, with the turbo it does just fine on acceleration. Break system is very good as well has stable during hard breaking.. Road noise ? Very quite. The motors does get heard when mashing the gas, but what do you expect. Got the LE AWD with cloth seat, didn't want leather. The reason I went with the Toyota is the 100,000 mile warranty is transferable, when non of the other would transfer. When you pay $30K for a vehicle, put 7K miles on it, then get a offer from the dealer of $5K more than I paid for it, seems I did good on this one."
