sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"2021 Kia Sportage SX Turbo, Pacific Blue with Beige interior package (really tan with charcoal edges, HOT! It has every smart safety upgrade, including the fact it can park itself either by backing into a slop or parallel. And then it can unpark itself. It has lane departure, but also will keep one in the lane utilizing adaptive cruise control as you go. Front and back avoidance and braking functions for the unexpected. On and on I could go. I agree with the other reviews about the interior and of course the spectacular panoramic roof (one touch). The glass all around is tinted fading to a lighter tint in front. The roof is tinted, doesn't glare as light pores in, feels cool and refreshing. The SPORT mode in driving as the Turbo to break out of the cage and be the tiger it is. Otherwise NORMAL and ECO modes feel just fine, more than enough power. While it may not be the very top it certainly comes in nice enough. Consider the paddle shifters on the back side of the steering wheel as a case in point, so VERY EASY to use. Infosys allows for every contingency in multiple ways to access. The adaptive cruise control drives, brakes, and adapts to the flow without a hitch, a major relief in itself. The lack of memory for the seats is a bummer but I can live with it. Even the thickness of the steering wheel feels just right. Easy vehicle to drive. 19"" tires lend a sense of security and handling wherever I go. The back cargo space has a spare tire and other space when you lift the lid for storage. It also drops in the event of a taller than normal box. This is a keeper. I wouldn't get the AWD unless I needed it. The mileage is better around town than I expected, 24.5 mpg average. Max they say is 28 mpg on the Hwy. I wonder with adaptive cruise control it won't be better than that (slightly - maybe 30 mpg.)"
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,I bought one; traded in my 2016 Turbo; don't try to sell me anything else. I've looked at infinity (had two and loved them) but for quality and value this is my choice!
sportage,4 out of 5 stars,"Having driven luxury SUV’s the past 20 years, this new Sportage turbo is fun to drive.  Most of the amenities you find in LEXUS models are available with a few omissions, yet at saving about 20k on the sticker price balances the purchase. The touchscreen apps and navigation are far easier to maneuver in the KIA than others.  Seating is comfortable but could be improved with a more sporty wrap around seat and it rides a little high in the cab for me.  The expansive sunroof is killer.  The things I miss are seat memory, seat belt release driver seat back up, one touch window up & down...spoiled I know.  Over all the Sportage was a good financial exchange for us.  My husband drives a SOUL, that’s what made us check out the other vehicles in the KIA line up."
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,The Kia Sportage is a great SUV. It fits me and my four grandchildren comfortably. It has a good amount of cargo space in the hatchback. Great on gas mileage. Handles great. A lot of good features available. Great midsize SUV. I have had 4.
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,Do your homework as I did and you'll make the same decision.  It ticks all my boxes for my needs and I get so many compliments.  We live in snow county and this SUV is a dream on the roads
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,Loved the 2018 and the 21 has more options
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,Love my new car. Love the sportage. Its the perfect in between car. Not too big and not too small.
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,Bought the 2021 Kia Sportage LX. Has everything but nav. Leather. Sunroof. Compared with Honda CRV. Toyota Rav4. Hyundai Tucson. MazdaC5. List $28700. Bought for $22450 plus total. Awesome build drive quality. Warranty best in lass.
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the most comfortable and smooth-driving vehicles i have ever owned. Tight steering and throttle, and the engine seems perfectly paired with the 6-speed transmission. The paddle shifters are almost redundant, as you can down shift more smoothly with the gas pedal. It has two downshift points, you just have to find them. It floats over bumps that my 2017 Taurus would channel up my spine directly into my cranium. The seats are comfy, and every control is within reach. Everything about this vehicle just feels effortless, and that's what i want out of my daily driver. Throw in that 5-year warranty, and I might just be buying Kias for my daily driver forever."
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"I supposed to get the 2021 Mazda CX5 but there was a problem in the approval of my loan documents, so I decided to go to my 2nd choice which is the Kia Sportage. I am only looking for an AWD option due to my hobby of going to some small adventure for desert and seashores in the small Country of Qatar. I picked the mid option which was having the AWD but when I finally collected the car, it was like a huge bomb dropped in front of me. I side mirrors, open when I get close to the car, and I can start the engine in as far as 10 meters from the vehicle. Going inside is just a press of a button and a push button start. There is a auto dimming rear view mirrors and a full roof of glass sun roof which can be physically opened halfway. Off road modes also present as I saw the center locking differential button and the hill descend control. Infotainment doesn't represent any branding but the sound is still top notch. Both driver set and front passenger set are electric adjustable only lumbar is added in the driver set. The inside cabin design is two toned  and very luxurious feel. Hand brakes are not electronic since its actually a foot brake but I didn't bother. The package also comes with a standard spare tire and aluminum wheel. Sets are very comfortable specially with the addition of the rear ac vents. Cabin is very quiet only you can hear the engine growl from 2000 rpm and higher. Steering is very good just a small indirect feeling but its not very noticeable not unless you have driven a Mazda CX5 for a long time. Setting position is very commanding and sets are perfect and very comfortable. Only I can say is, that this option is very close to the full option. The followings items are the only things making the gap being full a full option (adaptive cruise control, lane departure and lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert and stopping, electronic parking brake, paddle shifters, wireless phone charger, blind sport monitor, LED headlight, 19 inch wheel, power lift gate and full leather sets. But still Kia is giving us a very useful features that no other car making can do. Kudos Kia."
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"Test drive car and learn all the features the suv has to offer, it is awesome. You will love it"
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"I test drove the rav4, mazda 5, rogue, crv, terrain, equinox, edge, etc. Out of all of them, this was by far the most comfortable and comparable to my 2012 gmc terrain slt in size, seat comfort, and gadgets.
I love my 2021 sportage EX. Great hot heated seats. Drove some that barely got luke warm. Love the screen and blind spot warning (not a nuisance) as it really has only sounded off as needed. I love all of the features. It drives like a traditional car without the whining of the CVT transmissions. I have been getting better fuel economy than advertised. 26-27 combined.
Hopefully, this will be a mechanically sound vehicle (to soon to tell), but so far the comfort and convenience is everything I was looking for."
sportage,4 out of 5 stars,Has all the bells and whistles. Gas mileage is not the greatest compared to other similar vehicles.  Feel safe and comfortable driving
sportage,5 out of 5 stars,"It's a solid vehicle. The car handles well, and has very good acceleration. Front and back seats have decent room, and the cabin overall feels solid and looks good. Instrument panel is very well lighted up as are turn signals, etc. The trunk is a bit small but it works for me.  I get 23 mpg overall.   I get 30 mpg or more on highway using eco mode and cruise at 62 mph. It's a really nice car."

sportage,4 out of 5 stars,Love it! Love it! very nice SUV. So far very happy purchaser :)
sportage,3 out of 5 stars,"In general I'm a huge proponent of Korean manufacturers and all the strides they've made over the last 10 years or so. There's clear evidence of major improvements across various platforms, and investment into design and development across the entire Genesis / Hyundai / Kia lineup. 
I'll start with the good. The Sportage is a very unique looking car and is certainly not for everyone. But for those that appreciate its uniqueness, it's a wonder to look at and drive. Kia openly advertises the fact that its latest design includes components inspired by the Porsche Macan. My test drive experience of the fully loaded SX model resulted in an overall pleasant experience. I was amazed with the quality of interior, excellent heated & ventilated seats, the glass roof with a huge opening moon roof panel, the sound system, the intuitive entertainment and navigation, and the power train - the 2.0L performed wonderfully and never left me wanting more throughout its range on local streets and the highway. Nice Michelin tires were originally included with the car. One negative stood out right away - the road noise. But I was willing to live with it given all the positives. I bought the car and overall, with the exception of road noise and few corks around I still enjoy the drive a year and a half later. My FWD SX Turbo model gets me 26MPG average in an approximate 70/30 highway/local split, which isn't the greatest in its class but is respectable given the power and the cargo room it offers. The Sportage is one of those cars that's much bigger on the inside than out. It's very roomy. Most passengers can't believe how roomy and well appointed the interior is after seeing the exterior. Now on to the cons....
The Kia Sportage is the longest running model within Kia's lineup, so buying the 2021 top of the line SX trim I expected it to be completely refined with any potential issues ironed out. That was not the case, not even close. Instead, I've been having issues and non-stop dealer visits since day one. Out of the gate, day 1, the alignment was off and the car pulled to the left constantly while driving - unacceptable from a brand new vehicle and has never happened to me before (I purchased 18 brand new vehicles so far in my life). The infotainment head unit stopped working with Navigation just hanging endlessly if you try to put in an address. The head unit had to be replaced within 2 months of driving since new. There were few other body panel and door latch issues. The driver's door had to be slammed to actually latch closed. The weirdest issue by far, and the one that still haunts the car every few months and requires a dealer visit for some patch work, is the loud whistle at 50MPH coming from the left fender where the bumper seem meets the left fender. Issue occurred day one, and was in fact a LOUD whistle, I'm not exaggerating, that can be heard through music in side the vehicle and results in the most annoying drive experience you can imagine. After several dealer visits and them eventually involving Kia corporate engineers, the fix was put in place - some foaming insulation poured into the seem to fill in the gap and stop the whistle. It worked for few months until AZ heat caused the glue to separate and the panel to completely come off. The whole bumper had to then be replaced by the dealer (another week in the shop). Once replaced, the issue came back with vengeance! The seem had to be jammed open and more insulation foam went in. It's holding for now. The vehicle is about a year and a half old and it's been in the shop at least a month so far. I wish Kia included the memory driver's seat feature, at least in top trim models. We have 3 drivers in the household and constant manual adjustments are needed. I've had much cheaper vehicles that include the feature. The road noise gets worse with tire wear. I notice it more and more and it is noticed by most passengers that have experienced the competition, something like a CR-V, the CX-5 or the RAV4. Having had multiple Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia vehicles, I can say with fair certainty that the undercarriage insulation is only done correctly in their Genesis lineup. Kia and Hyundai are insulated in a minimalist fashion to save on weight and costs. My G80 was whisper quiet on the road. But then again, it cost twice as much as the Sportage. One more and final big gripe is the dealer experience. The facility, the staff, the very obvious lack of training in all areas are seriously getting to me. I dread each visit these days, even for regular maintenance. I often find myself having to tell the service specialist what to do to fix a given issue. In summary, I feel like the Sportage, being one of the oldest models in the company's lineup, could have used a little more quality control and attention to detail in its manufacturing process. This could have been a great seller and competitor, but instead falls short in areas that are actually fairly simple to address."
