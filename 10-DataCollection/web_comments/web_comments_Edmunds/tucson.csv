tucson,5 out of 5 stars,I traded my 2020 Sonata in for a Tucson value. I needed an SUV for practicality and health reasons.. all I can say is I’m very happy with Tucson Value I bought.comfortable and quiet ride. Easy to get in and out of and good storage. I thought performance and fuel consumption would be a down side of buying this car. Fuel consumption on a long highway run doing around 80 mph was just over 34 mpg. About 30 mpg running around locally. So better than I anticipated. Performance wise. It’s adequate and if you need more zip I can select Sport mode. All in all I’m happy with my choice.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I love my Tucson Limited. I originally test drove the Value trim and like other reviews didn't like the acceleration and wanted more features. The Limited has all that and then some. The 2.4 is way more responsive and I love my heated steering wheel, leather heated seats and xfinity sound system!"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Smooth ride...getting 33mpg which is better than suggested which is great..nice storage area and rides very well.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable seating, roomy inside, but doesn’t feel boxy.  Smooth quiet ride, no problems with acceleration up hills or on highway.  Dash controls smartly placed, not overwhelming."
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"I've had the Tuscon Value for about a month now. I love the amount of features it has (personal favorite: auto hold button and Blue Link service). The seats are nice and firm. Some people have criticized the cheap look and feel of the interior but think of this car as practical and functional rather than for luxury. The cargo space is great and Hyundai is very generous with its included accessories. The worst thing about the car is the mpg and lack of acceleration. I fill up on average a week and a half even though I don't drive it long distances. If you can overlook this, you won't regret your purchase."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I bought a 2021 Hyundai Tucson Ultimate because I prefer the size over a Santa Fe and I have been extremely pleased with it.  It has a great, smooth, quiet ride, a solid feel and lots of nice tech.  And I LOVE that Sport Mode and panoramic roof!  The internet keeps touting the ""new"" model with a few extra lights on the front, the odd looking wheels and the dents in the side.  I think mine is MUCH prettier, ""tougher"" looking and well...just more expensive looking.  I think Hyundai makes really great vehicles though and I have bought Hyundai for the past several years.  Just glad I bought my Tucson when I did."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"That Hyundai is so much more bang for your buck and having come from the Toyota and Honda world, you will be much happier with this brand!"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"The SEL model is a good all around vehicle with lots of safety features, high road clearance making it great for those who deal with snow, has a simple to use infotainment center, smooth ride with lots of extras like heated seats and mirrors."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Purchased a 2021 Tucson SEL 2 months ago. Smooth ride and lots of options for the money. Getting 27 miles per galleon in the City and 32 on the highway.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,I love my Tucson! Rides smooth and comfortable. Just enough space to where you don't feel like your driving a tank but plenty of room to stretch out in.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Just purchased a few days ago but so far so good. Rides nice and has so many included options I doubt I'll every learn how to use them all. Comfortable driver, passenger and rear seats. Hope to get a lot of trouble free years from this good looking vehicle."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking, smooth ride, love that way it rides on the highway."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"What a surprise! I've been a Honda/Acura driver all my life, but read a lot of reviews on the Tucson. Once I test drove it, I knew it was the car for me. Absolutely love the way it handles and its many features. It's actually fun to drive.  Highly recommend the Tucson"
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"I have had my 2021 Tucson Limited for about a month, after driving a Subaru Legacy for a decade. So far, County me impressed. I love the extra room and safety features on the Tucson. The leather trim and heated seats provide a touch of luxury.
The lengthy warranty offers peace of mind, and my dealer includes free oil changes for life. All signs of the quality of the vehicle.
The front window offers a great view but the rear view is slightly obscured by the back seat head rests.
There is more than enough pep in the engine for me, but there is a slight drop in fuel economy. The only other quibble is the wind noise when it is howling outside... not unbearable but noticeable.
I anticipate loving my Hyundai for many Mike’s to come."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Great car with unbeatable warranty. Hyundai is so confident in their manufactured car they warranty bumper to bumper for 5 years - 60k and 10 years 100k on powertrain. Other manufacturers only offer standard 3 years 36k bumper to bumper and 5 years 60k powertrain. Why? Aren't the other car manufacturers as confident in the quality of their product? Answer - No they are not.
tucson,3 out of 5 stars,"In the 4 months, I've owned this car I've had to use roadside assistance 3 times. The car just wouldn't start. After 2 times service it was determent that I had a faulty battery. Also, this car doesnt have a compass and to use Homelink to open the garage door the car must be on, I repeat...If you turned the car off BEFORE oppening your garage door you'll have to turn it back on in order to use Homelink.The rear door will open automatically if you stand near it for even a very short period of time with you key on you, whether you want it or not. I see this as a sefety issue. Android auto has very poor resolution on the screen and is very unreliable, it keeps getting disconnected. If you do get this car I recommend getting it with the good old navigation system. Pros: Price, nicely appointed interior, comfortable quiet ride.
I feel I've made a mistake getting this car."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Great response and economy
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a 2018 Tucson to a 2021 Tucson, even after exploring other Hyundai model options. It’s just a great car. Very spacious, drives and handles well, and gets the job done. Very reliable and some new upgrades like lane assist, as well as a sleeker design. You can’t go wrong."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,I have owned Hyundai Kia Products products for years. This is my first SUV with the brand. I love it I think the ride is very composed and smooth. The Infinity sound system is really clear and bumps the bass. I am eager awaiting the release of the Santa Cruze and hope it performs as well as the Tuscon.
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, in the compact SUV segment, the 2021 Tucson is not the best in anything, but it is very good in everything.  With the excellent price, excellent safety ratings, and best warranty over its competitors, it was the right vehicle for my wife to shuttle our 2 kids around town for the next 5-10 years (or more).  The ride and the seats are a little firm, but still comfortable.

My one gripe is there is no trip odometer!  I don't think that's a deal breaker for anyone, but seems an odd choice by Hyundai not to provide it."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Had a like vehicle in the past but this one far outdoes the older vehicle.
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"I traded my 2017 Electra for 2021 ultimate. Beautiful sleek vehicle in Hyundai style. High end vehicle with many bells and whistles but yet lacks the simple things like no fob remote ( BlueLink only), wireless charging. Super annoying to purchase a top trim and still have to pay extra for mud flaps.. seriously?!?!!
The vehicle is a nice smooth ride and I hope to get many years from it"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,I really like the car for the money. The customer service was great too.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Just bought the 2021 Tucson sport and have to say so far it is one of the nicest vehicles I’ve ever driven and that’s over 45 yrs !! Comfortable, great ride , all safety features ! Can’t say enough"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I call it ""simply the best"" because it has it all..smooth on the road, roomy inside and a classy look everything's  perfect.."
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,I bought a 2021 tucson ultimate. The cameras are blurry and it is a common complaint that hyundai needs to address. When you buy the top trim with leather interior you would expect more leather on the door panels. The infotainment display is slow to respnd to voice commands. I suggest moving the blind spot warnings to the interior as in some day time conditions they are difficult to see. I have the 2.4l engine with the 6 speed. The engine is smooth and has good power. The transmission shift are smooth also. The ride is a little firm but not harsh. The fit and finish are very good. As with any product there is room for improvement such as fuel millage. I am happy very happy with the over all product.
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I had a Tucson a few years ago, traded it for a Kona, went back to the Tucson, I love it, size, ride, it's perfect!!"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Coming from a 2012 Santa Fe which got over 180K absolutely trouble free miles, we shopped Hyundai products extensively and for 2021 the Tucson Sport with all of the features, safety, upgrades, and Hyundai reputation seemed like the perfect fit for us. This is my wife's car and compared to the older Santa Fe, is actually roomier and much more comfortable. Even for me, the seats are large enough and perfectly bolstered to hold you firm while driving. Smooth and comfortable, the ride lacks nothing. Brakes and steering are actually much better than expected. And we love the Sport styling. We got ours brand new, out the door, with complete roof rack and other extras for less than 27,500.00. Our Santa Fe does have a 3.5 V6 and by comparison the Tucson with the 2.4 does not accelerate the same. But, it is more than enough to merge, and move out of the way if needed. Given all of the other features and comforts, it is good trade off. And, sport mode helps this if you find it necessary."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,I had a 2015 before and I live it. This new one however made me fall in love with the tuscon all over again. I am and will remain a Hyundai girl!!
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"Love it, quiet ride, nice and comfortable, all kinds goodies on it, fuel mileage could be a bit better I think! All in all, great vehicle!"
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"We just bought the car and immediately drove from Bradenton to Long Island NY...very comfortable ride...great lumbar support. We had quite a bit of rain and she handled beautifully. Best wipers ever. Nothing bad to say , really."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I love my new SUV. I have bought 2 Hyundai Sonatas. I loved them, but wanted a change. I wanted a small SUV that was as easy to maneuver as a car, and had great gas mileage as my midsized car. I have found that with my Tucson. I love the features, and the roominess. I am obsessed."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"This is our second Tucson. More HP and bells and whistles on this new one.
So much more for the money than Toyota can offer. Very, very happy with our new 2021 Tucson!"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,It’s a nice all around SUV!
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,Know your information of what you plan to spend and stick to it.
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,"Papa bear bought the Santa Fe, and Mama Bear bought the Tucson.  Perfect"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I needed a car and I didn’t want another GM, I had a 2014 Chevy Malibu, that was nice inside and out but the engine has a defect I it that GM needs to deal with"
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,the car is a beauty
tucson,4 out of 5 stars,Love this car - although basic - so annoying that opening trunk hatch has to be manual. Hands are always full when opening/ closing. Sort of punishing to have to put everything down or pick up to open trunk hatch. It’s a deal breaker.
tucson,3 out of 5 stars,"Exterior looks fine.  Decent interior room.  Seats are fine.  Noise, low wind noise, high tire noise, suspension was noisy, quieted down after some miles.  MPG with a good mix of driving is low to mid 20's.  Steering, sloshy sensation especially when you let off & get back on the accelerator.  Alignment is fine.  Power, has a delay when you first accelerate then it goes.  If you need to go somewhere quickly forget it especially on the freeways.  Press and wait.  Engine noise is decent.  Brakes are grabby trash.  No sensation of warping.  Cheap windshield glass, be sure to get glass coverage."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"This vehicle has been everything I’d hoped for and more. Great ride, plenty of cargo space, good gas mileage. I was a first time Hyundai owner but this will not be my last. Love this vehicle."
tucson,5 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad I leased the last body style. I am not a fan of the new ones looks.  I love everything about this Tucson.  The truck looks amazing In the charcoal gray color with the chrome grill.  I got the limited.  Love the heated seats, and steering wheel.  I love the remote start from the app and also the infinity sound system.  Gas mileage is good for me and the car is very comfortable.  I am not sure if I will buy out the lease but since I don’t like the new one I may"
