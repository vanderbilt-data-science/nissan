"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
Noisy when going over bumps
I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car…"
Could use updated computer screen
Love this car…my second one…best bang for your buck. I’m not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable…just have what I need and use daily…
I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
Update engine shutoff
"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
great road car
none
This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."

Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."

Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car…"
Could use updated computer screen
Love this car…my second one…best bang for your buck. I’m not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable…just have what I need and use daily…
I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
Update engine shutoff
"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
great road car
none
This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."

Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
Noisy when going over bumps
I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.

Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
Update engine shutoff
"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
great road car
none
This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."

Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
Noisy when going over bumps
I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."

"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."

This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."

Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
Noisy when going over bumps
I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car…"
Could use updated computer screen
Love this car…my second one…best bang for your buck. I’m not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable…just have what I need and use daily…
I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.

We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
Noisy when going over bumps
I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car…"
Could use updated computer screen
Love this car…my second one…best bang for your buck. I’m not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable…just have what I need and use daily…
I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
Update engine shutoff
"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
great road car
none
This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."

Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."

"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.

"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car…"
Could use updated computer screen
Love this car…my second one…best bang for your buck. I’m not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable…just have what I need and use daily…
I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
No ventilated seats
"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I’ve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
Update engine shutoff
"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
great road car
none
This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
The wheels in the front are loud.
"I own a Touring so it’s fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you’re not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I’ve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
As stated above
None
Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
Smooth ride and comfortable seating
No Blind Spot Monitor
"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Electrical... all of the electrical
"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
