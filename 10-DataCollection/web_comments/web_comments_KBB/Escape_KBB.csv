"White Escape Hybrid titanium.  Glad we decided on this instead of Rav4.
It's a luxury car for us 'middle-weight' type people.
Everything is fine...right now.  More satisfied with the 2020 model than our 2016 titanium.  Quiet, handles well, like switches, leather upholstery comfortable,  visibility good, safety good, very good audio, and good grunt when needed.
Driving 2/3's city and 1/3rd highways(2 lane mostly) currently averaging 42.2 mpg!'"
Car has the 3 cyl eng..would not recommend it to anyone..has vibration in high gear on highway like it is underpowered...transmission is jerky at startup..maybe a different engine would make a difference but maybe not..not satisfied at all with my escape..

Interior and exterior design . MPG.
"Front seat buckets. Look nice, but not comfortable"
"Nice improvements over my previous 2019 Escape 2.0L, ...with a few exceptions. Handling, interior space and exterior design are all notable pluses. The most bothersome exception is the seat comfort; -the lower half, or bucket. Regardless of adjustment. Tolerable around town, but quite fatiguing for out-of-town trips. Surprised because the 2019 was fine. Secondly, most of the mountain driving fun is gone due to the power concession for the hybrid & CVT, but there's an acceptable trade-off there as I'm currently averaging 39 MPG; -roughly twice what the 2.0L was getting. I'd recommend a buy if Ford would just improve the seat buckets."
nice driving with good handling.
no complaints.
"like new, excellent mileage, in perfect condition, mostly driven by an old man in the city. brakes and cameras work well."
Looks very nice
"Noisy, numerous issues"
"I own a 2020 Ford Escape that I've put less than 10,000 miles on in two years, and despite the relatively low usage I've experienced a number of issues with the car. These include:

-The powertrain control system detecting evaporative vapor emissions blocking a valve. This required us to have a sensor replaced less than a year after purchasing the car.

-When we went to get the car inspected the OBD-2 meter that monitors emissions was not able to be read by 5 separate state inspection sites. This was caused by a known issue with the software in newer Escapes (year 2020 and beyond, as well as other Ford vehicles). Because of this, I had to put my car in the shop and have the software updated within the first 
~1.5 years of owning the car. This seriously delayed my ability to get my car registered in a new state and receive a drivers license

-The Easy Fuel gas cap causes a number of issues when filling up the car, and I often have to squeeze the nozzle 10-20 times to fill up my tank 

-The cabin is extremely loud, even on paved roads. Air annoyingly whistles in the doors, and any asphalt or alternative road surfaces cause extremely loud noise in the car.

As a final note, we've had to deal with eight different licenses Ford service stations in two states, and all but one were incredibly awful experiences. This included appointment wait times of over a month; no reasonable options for same-day services; inability to address the issue without shipping the car elsewhere or keeping it for 1-2 weeks; and websites that are incredibly difficult for users. This made dealing with all of these issues incredibly difficult on us as a single car family."
Quick from a green light
Don't trust co-poilt 100%
"My family is a Ford family but I have driven many other Makes/Models. I was driving a 2020 Mazda CX-5 which had been my second one, and loved it until a deer took the side out but not enough to total it. The repair shop couldn't fix it correctly and this option for a 2021 Escape with a heafty slu of rebates came my way. I decided to purchase the Escape. I drive 20,000 miles a year, 6'3"" bigger build. This car has a great amount of room and packed with 4-adults it is quite comfortable. Interior is nicely done and was surprised it was a Ford (Mazdas was way nicer). Inside the Escape everything is within proper reach, heated seats and steering wheel warm up quickly in the dead of a cold Michigan morning. The AWD system is ok, it plows through snow but unless you're in slippery mode it hesitates for a second and the backend likes to swing a lot. B&O sound system is great but I am on my second subwoofer and probably going for my third (not my doing). It's 3-cylinder engine sounds strong and takes off quickly but it's GOTTA go pass a semi while cars are coming on the freeway umph is just ok. Ford's co-poilt 1.0 system doesn't make me feel very safe I'm always fighting it compared to Mazda, Ford should ask for advice. Overall it's a very good little SUV.
One more thing, the brakes are the most sensitive & noisy brakes I have ever owned on a car, quite embarrassing... Dealer ii it was because cheaper materials are being used."
"Smooth drive, nice interior, Apple CarPlay"
"Small engine, glitchy bluetooth"
"I love this vehicle. It looks beautiful, getting better gas mileage than it says, drives smoothly, and the SEL trim has a more than nice interior. My only criticisms are the Bluetooth glitches sometimes (a problem I had in my ‘17 Ford Focus), and I don’t like how it comes with a standard 3 cylinder engine. Otherwise, this is a wonderful vehicle"
Like brand new
Perfect
Perfect condition hardly ever driven. Only 2200 miles and it runs beautifully. Perfect family car. Nice!
FUN TO DRIVE
I wish the modes wouls stay set.
We traded in our 2016 for the new SEL with the 1.5 turbo and had a tow package put on it when we bought it. I worried about because I pull a 5x8 box trailer because I fly R/C Airplanes. I even took my daughters things to Chicago in the trailer and it pulled great up there and back and I had the trailer loaded pretty heavy. We averaged 28 mpg going up and 30 coming home. Our 2016 would not even get that on a good day. I would recommend the 2020 to anyone. I know it is not made to pull a trailer but it does it in style.
I just leased 2021 Escape with 1.5 Engine 3 Cylinder. This model has several problems and doesn't drive smooth. It make rattling noise when accelerates and make clicking noise when shifting the gear nob. There is grunting noise coming from the heat area. Ford did terrible job on this model. Stay away from this model of Ford and always test drive any car very well before purchasing becasue you could find too many problems even if It's brand new.
"technical features, solid for medium duty."
"Being a traditional American driver, a 3 cylinder engine doesn't cut it in a car the size of an Escape.  So I have the 2.0L turbo 4 SEL trim. It's been about 15 years since I've had a car this big and it's a treat for me.
To my taste, Ford styling has generally been contemporary but not gaudy (looking at you Lexus and Hyundai).   The Escape is more powerful, comfortably bigger, a bit plusher, better towing than the 2018 EcoSport I'm coming from. It has all the features that make it one A.I. computer shy of self driving. The interior is attractive but serviceable for cleaning.  Friends who've ridden with me comment on it's smooth ride and spaciousness."
"Drives great, good mph"
Haven't found any yet.
Titanium with sunroof and trailer package.  It has everything I was looking for at a price that didn't break the bank. Great options and performance you won't believe. With 250 horsepower I doubt I'll ever have to use the sport mode.
"My last 4 vehicles were Taurus and I loved each one.  This time I purchased the Escape and I really like it.  I took it on a 600 mile round trip the week after I got it.  Got great gas mileage.  I wondered if it would be as comfortable a ride as my Taurus and it was just fine.  I really like the suv.  For a senior citizen, it was getting hard to lift things out of the trunk of the car, but loading and unloading the cargo area of the Escape is so much easier.  So far I really am very satisfied with the Escape and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Lots of extras, AWD, WiFi and Sirius XM"
No rear cargo cover unless car is ordered with it
"Looks like a Porsche grille.  The SEL has many features that an older driver can use effectively (rear camera, cross traffic warn, lane keeping, back up warning, speed control, heated wheel, seats, remote start).  I stepped up from a 2.0  2013 SE and am so happy with the purchase.  I wanted the car to grow with my eventual limitations (I’m 66, but an active 66).  I feel the car will grow old with me and it will still be stylish to impress my friends!  Keep the wifi, it will link to your phone and Maps will help.  The 2.0 and AWD are really useful, real zippy and control is effortless.  FWD is just not enough in snow for me here in CO. so that AWD was a selling point."
"Fast, Lots of Technology, Roomy, Versatile"
"Cheap Interior, Expensive"
"So far my Escape has been great. I'm 6'2"" and stocky and the cabin does not feel cramped. The backseat can slide forward and back a few inches which is nice also, I have not yet had any complaints about lack of space in the backseats. The 2.0L Ecoboost is definitely the way to go. It is fast and once I discovered the sport mode, I haven't really used any of the other ones. It accelerates quick and overtakes without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately Ford does not give you the option of choosing your default drive mode. So every time you start your vehicle you have to page through all the different modes until you get to the one you want. 

We get some snow where I live and the Escape did fine in light snow and ice. There's a drive mode for slippery conditions that slows the vehicle and lowers throttle response to prevent loss of traction. The stock tires are ok but not great in heavy rain and snow. I have not yet had the opportunity to try out the deep snow and sand mode yet. I noticed that TCS is disabled in that mode but I cannot comment on how throttle and shift points are affected. 

The entertainment center is responsive and intuitive. Apple car play can be spotty at times and won't connect properly. I have found that as long as I wait until everything has started up before plugging in my phone it works good. 

The B&O speakers sound fine but I could not tell a difference between any other car stereo I've ever had. Also the heads up display is a neat gimmick but it's just above the instrument cluster that displays all the same info. It will display driving directions but only if you use ford navigation. It does not interact with car play. 

The interior materials really do appear cheap, lots of plastic everywhere. Other than the accent panel that runs through the middle of the dash and a few pieces of leather on places you rest your arms on, it's all plastic. 

Adaptive cruise control works really well and I like that I can set the follow distance. Be careful on the highway, while trying to overtake with adaptive cruise active your vehicle may suddenly brake because of a semi or other slow moving vehicle up ahead. This has happened to me a few times and can be dangerous and unnerving if you drive aggressively. 

Parking assist is a cool feature and works as advertised most of the time. I've had a few instances where it tried to cram into too small of a spot and just stops after backing halfway in. 

High beams can be set to auto as well. So you can turn on auto lights and auto high beams and never touch either again, ever.
 
Ford connect is an app you can download on your phone allowing you to remote start from the app. The app also displays lots of vehicle info, including tire pressure. With remote start, the climate control will default to where it was last set. 

Exterior trim scratches easily so be careful where you lean. 

I recommend the vehicle but only if you can get a good deal on it. It's pretty good at 30-32,000 but I wouldn't pay any more than that at the dealership."
"Comfortable, peppy, amazing safety features."
A bit more expensive than similarly equipped CUV's
"Got this Escape Titanium AWD for commuting. I drive 50 mi each way, 3 days a week. The active safety features were the big differentiator for me. CoPilot360 tech package with the adaptive cruise control is an absolute game changer. Parallel park assist is amazing.

The vehicle is almost as comfortable as my full size pickup but with much better gas mileage. I would definitely recommend it."
Roomy. Good traction in snow and rain.
A little on the cheap feeling side.
Fuel economy doesn't match the window sticker. Engine is busy sounding. Sounds like it's working a little hard. Overall it's a good little SUV.
