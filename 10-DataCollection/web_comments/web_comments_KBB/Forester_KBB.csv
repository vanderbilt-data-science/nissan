CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle."
"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created."

I can’t think of any. I love this car.
"I am a loyal Subaru fan, and went from an Outback to a Forester.  Love this car because it is comfortable with plenty of room and stylish.  A plus is that it is a beast in the snow.  Love the softer seats and so easy to clean.  Wish Subaru would come out with a hybrid model for better gas mileage."

"This car is very 'features rich'.  I traded my 2017 in for more safety features, especially Rear Auto Braking, and braking in front.  The lane departure feature is good, but not necessary in all cases. 
The mileage per gallon is what I expected. Much better than my 2013 Kia Soul.  The vehicle has everything I need, and many other things.  I love it!!"
"Very comfortable car, Touring model with top features, lightly driven during pandemic, in excellent condition."
"Comfortable, fuel economy, awd, reliability"
Some safety features were a bit confusing at first
"Very comfortable,  good fuel economy, great winter driver. Have owned both the Rav4 and CRV and the Forester has won me over. I looked at all 3 prior to my purchase, test drove, read research, etc on each before deciding. Coming from owning both Toyotas and Hondas, it was a leap of faith as I had great experiences with both. Looking back, glad I made the change. No regrets."
"So pretty, everyone comments on it. Love Subarus!"
There are no cons. It's comfortable driving long
Had to get larger car to enable disabled husband get in the vehicle.  He can't bend his legs to get in & out.
"AWD, driver assistance, infotainment"
Pricy
"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version."
Loaded with advanced features.
Radio is good. Gas economy far from advertised especially city driving. Outside features are very nice except the looks. Long and narrow. Not very stable on the road if compare to my Mazda CX-5.
Excellent visibility
Very weak engine
"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Reliable
"Slow, noisy engine"
"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Some radio issues
"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Gas mileage great easy getting in and out
"Cup holder location, auto shut off, viberation"
"Car has a vibration in seats and floor, had 4 sets of tires, rims changed, new drive shaft, Axiel change out been with dealer over 30 days wait wait wait"
"Most dependable, great to drive."
"A wire burn-up under the driver seat, unsure why?"
"This car was purchased for the wife, she loves it. She'd like to buy another Forester but not many available to match this one. Looking for a 2021. She'd like the rea pwr. gate with her next purchase. I like the car also, it's a fun drive and has all the equip. needed for a 2nd get-around car. We have taken good care of this car and will miss it. It's just time to trade up."
It basically drives itself
Engine auto shut off is loud and gets annoying
"This is the first new car I’ve ever owned, and with this model, it’s actually been a great investment. I love it so much, tho, I couldn’t imagine selling it."
Quality brand in every respect.
Interior could be a bit more plush.
"First, I’ve owned eight Subarus! Why you ask? Reliability, dependability, safety, quality and fuel economy for a full time AWD vehicle. Having lived in WV most all my 67 years, I can attest to the capabilities Subaru puts into their cars. Come snow, rain and whatever else, Subaru comes through every single time. And my 2021 Forester Limited takes us wherever and back safely while sipping fuel at an average of 28-32 MPG! Fit and finish are exceptionally good and the cabin, while not super fancy, is quiet and comfortable. Subarus price point is very reasonable for their top of the line Forester. If you are looking for a vehicle that can do it all, I suggest you at least test drive one. You’ll be surprised and hooked at the same time! Happy trails."
Top of the line with every safety feature
audio system
"2019 Subaru ForesterTouring - So many safety features, ""all wheel"" drive, fit and finish is top of the line, audio system is below par, value is better than almost any car on the market, white is the best color for the market."

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle."
"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created."

Coming from owning both Toyotas and Hondas, it was a leap of faith as I had great experiences with both. Looking back, glad I made the change. No regrets."
"So pretty, everyone comments on it. Love Subarus!"
There are no cons. It's comfortable driving long
Had to get larger car to enable disabled husband get in the vehicle.  He can't bend his legs to get in & out.

Pricy
"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version."
Loaded with advanced features.
Radio is good. Gas economy far from advertised especially city driving. Outside features are very nice except the looks. Long and narrow. Not very stable on the road if compare to my Mazda CX-5.
Excellent visibility
Very weak engine
"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Reliable
"Slow, noisy engine"
"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Some radio issues
"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Gas mileage great easy getting in and out

"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Reliable
"Slow, noisy engine"
"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Some radio issues
"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Gas mileage great easy getting in and out
"Cup holder location, auto shut off, viberation"
"Car has a vibration in seats and floor, had 4 sets of tires, rims changed, new drive shaft, Axiel change out been with dealer over 30 days wait wait wait"
"Most dependable, great to drive."
"A wire burn-up under the driver seat, unsure why?"
"This car was purchased for the wife, she loves it. She'd like to buy another Forester but not many available to match this one. Looking for a 2021. She'd like the rea pwr. gate with her next purchase. I like the car also, it's a fun drive and has all the equip. needed for a 2nd get-around car. We have taken good care of this car and will miss it. It's just time to trade up."
It basically drives itself
Engine auto shut off is loud and gets annoying
"This is the first new car I’ve ever owned, and with this model, it’s actually been a great investment. I love it so much, tho, I couldn’t imagine selling it."
Quality brand in every respect.
Interior could be a bit more plush.
"First, I’ve owned eight Subarus! Why you ask? Reliability, dependability, safety, quality and fuel economy for a full time AWD vehicle. Having lived in WV most all my 67 years, I can attest to the capabilities Subaru puts into their cars. Come snow, rain and whatever else, Subaru comes through every single time. And my 2021 Forester Limited takes us wherever and back safely while sipping fuel at an average of 28-32 MPG! Fit and finish are exceptionally good and the cabin, while not super fancy, is quiet and comfortable. Subarus price point is very reasonable for their top of the line Forester. If you are looking for a vehicle that can do it all, I suggest you at least test drive one. You’ll be surprised and hooked at the same time! Happy trails."
Top of the line with every safety feature
audio system
"2019 Subaru ForesterTouring - So many safety features, ""all wheel"" drive, fit and finish is top of the line, audio system is below par, value is better than almost any car on the market, white is the best color for the market."
