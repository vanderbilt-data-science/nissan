"It’s a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice.

"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
Fun to drive
No cons
Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!
wheels/rims need a style upgrade
"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."

"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

Reliability
not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"

Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!
wheels/rims need a style upgrade
"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."

"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

"I've owned a lot of cars in my time but this is by far my favorite. It handles well, rides smooth, and is so quiet on the highway. Super comfortable--and the mileage can't be beat. Love my new Rav4 Hybrid!"
Reliability
not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
"It’s a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior… there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"

"I've owned a lot of cars in my time but this is by far my favorite. It handles well, rides smooth, and is so quiet on the highway. Super comfortable--and the mileage can't be beat. Love my new Rav4 Hybrid!"

"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
"It’s a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior… there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
Fun to drive
No cons
Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!
wheels/rims need a style upgrade
"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"

"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
Fun to drive
No cons
Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!
wheels/rims need a style upgrade
"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."

"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

Reliability
not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
"It’s a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior… there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
"It’s a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior… there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
Fun to drive
No cons
Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!

"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."

The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior… there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
Great gas mileage
Not much
"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
"Head room is low , no remote start"
"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it’s on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
Fun to drive
No cons
Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
Loved driving my car!!!
I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
Fun to drive!
wheels/rims need a style upgrade
"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
NONE
"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
Great reliability and value.
Seems to be made for short people.
"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."
"very quick and responsive 219 hp, roomy and quiet,comfortable, fun to drive
BONUS...COASTAL SOUTH CAROLINA DRIVING...CONSTANT 44.7 MILES PER GAL
AMAZING ...BEEN DRIVING TOYOTAS FOR 44 YEARS"
Space to small  millage  supost  is 46 charged really only 35 mill price sobre evaluate  and the tax deductible  is 7500  is nothing  is not real
"I've owned a lot of cars in my time but this is by far my favorite. It handles well, rides smooth, and is so quiet on the highway. Super comfortable--and the mileage can't be beat. Love my new Rav4 Hybrid!"
Reliability
not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
