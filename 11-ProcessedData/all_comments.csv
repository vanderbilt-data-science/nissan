Model,Souce,Comment
Rogue,Cars,I‚Äôve had my 2021 Rogue SL with the premium package for a month now. What a change from previous Nissans!  I love all the technology and convenient features. The 9 inch touch screen is responsive and very easy to see in bright sun. Love the panoramic sunroof and the quality of the interior. The seats are so comfortable. Ride quality is improved. People who complain about a 2.5 with a CVT should not be shopping for 4 cylinder SUV. Who cares how fast it gets to 60 mph?  This SUV in sport mode does just fine when needed. I have to say this has much more responsive acceleration off the line than my Murano had but I get much better fuel economy. I usually drive mine in auto or eco modes to take advantage of the better mpg. I give Nissan huge kudos and was happy to get this 2.5 4 cylinder since 2022s are all 1.5 turbo 3 cylinders.  Yes better gas mileage but the 2.5 is proven and solid.
Rogue,Cars,"I have to preface this by saying I purchased another new car recently and it ended up being a Lemon which the manufacturer repurchased (or is repurchasing because the process drags on forever). That said, I‚Äôm a little hyper sensitive to any issues with cars right now. I test drove the Rogue just to ‚Äúcheck it out‚Äù with no intention on purchasing so quickly after my Lemon experience but I fell in love with it. It‚Äôs roomy, has a ton of great features, crystal clear back up/surround camera, awesome moonroof, great MPG‚Äôs, etc etc.  Even though the features and look of the car is great, I noticed little glitches from day one. The cameras would switch on randomly when slowing the car during travel, the automatic breaking warning light would come on and then turn off, the radio was working and then sounded like I was in a tunnel and then resumed playing normally, AC blew hot air when on cool until I turned it down to ‚ÄúLo‚Äù, the touch screen acts crazy here and there, etc etc. For the most part I wrote these things off as ‚Äúuser error‚Äù or accepting that maybe the car just acted like this. BUT‚Ä¶today after owning the car for about two weeks/600 miles the emergency breaking malfunction light came on and remained on (I‚Äôm talking about the big, bright notice that pops up in your dash cluster). Like the other ‚Äúglitches‚Äù the malfunction light disappeared when I parked, turned off the car and then turned it on again. I realized that the glitches might be a little more than what I originally thought though. Having the malfunction light in addition to the warning symbols prompted me to take the car in to service. I‚Äôm currently waiting to find out what the issue is and how long it will take to fix. I also did some more review reading and I have to say that I‚Äôm really nervous that the car will have continuing issues. The reviews on this site are fairly positive but if you look around a bit more you find some scary stuff about this car. I really thought there was no possible way that I would have this type of experience with TWO brand new cars within a six month period but here we are. I hope this is just some weird full moon voodoo that gets repaired and never causes me an issue again but I‚Äôm really not that confident in that right now. All I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶be careful!"
Rogue,Cars,"Recently traded in my 2016 for the new redesigned 2021 Rogue. The difference is amazing. The build quality has important greatly, styling is upgraded, feels like a much more expensive vehicle. 
Incredible value, very happy with purchase."
Rogue,Cars,Meets our needs comfortable  stylish love the interior and the ride is super cool. We choose black it is beautiful and cool and super nice
Rogue,Cars,Always have been a huge fan of Rogues but I absolutely LOVE this 3rd generation ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù!  Love the exterior and most of all the interior! The ride is smoother and more quiet as well! I‚Äôve had my Rogue for about a week now and have I put about 700 miles on it and so far so good! 100% would recommend as Nissans have never let me down!
Rogue,Cars,Very spacious and economic . Great choice and great color . I was looking for a family car and this car has everything I need it.
Rogue,Cars,My first SUV and I am very happy with it.  The technology is amazing and the car rides so smoothly.  So glad I picked the Rogue
Rogue,Cars,"It's very dependable even in the winter. The back seats are full size to fit adults comfortably. Large screen for GPS or music, Tac & Digital speedometer."
Rogue,Cars,"I have owned/leased Nissans since 1997. I had a 1997,  2001, 2004 and 2013 Pathfinder. I had a 2007 Xterra, 2011 Rogue, 2016 Murano and the 2019 Rogue SL. I have to say that the 2021 Rogue SL, with the premium package is my best leased Nissan yet. Coming from the 2011 & 2019 Rogue, the 2021 is a BIG improvement. The exterior is beautiful and the interior is so luxurious without the luxurious price tag. I did not think I would like the gear shifter, but I love it, especially now that I have more storage space underneath it and the cup holders are up higher. I have loved the zero gravity seats since my 2013 Pathfinder. OMG, they are so comfortable and the back seats are a little bit higher and I love that too. The back doors opening at a 90 degree angle is like the best thing EVER. The ability  to unlock all the doors from all 4 doors is a great feature as well.  I just leased mine on memorial day, and I am 110% in love. They have made the cabin quieter and even though it is just 11hp more, you can definitely feel the difference. It lagged a bit in the 2019, but not this 2021. Huge difference in acceleration alone! Still log my propilot assist, lane change monitoring and so much more. The wireless connection to my iphone is great too. I just love it! 2021 Boulder Gray Pearl Nissan Rogue SL w/premium package :)"
Rogue,Cars,"A nice overall improvement  (gas mileage not included) from my previous 2018 Rogue.  All the ""bells and whistles"" needed to enjoy a comfortable ride from here to there."
Rogue,Cars,As a 51 year old empty nester this vehicle seems to meet all my needs. No longer need a bigger SUV or minivan. Took me a little while to come to that realization but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy anything larger. Very quiet and comfortable and I get about 33 MPG commuting to the office and back. Family members with CR-Vs and Outbacks are very impressed with this new design. Check it out.
Rogue,Cars,"At first I had no problem with my brand new Rogue, but six weeks after driving the car shut down in my driveway. Information such as ‚ÄúHeadlight malfunction, apply parking break. ‚Äú remained on the dashboard. The car couldn‚Äôt start, had to get a jump. The next morning I took the car to the dealership and after 4.5 hour was told that my ECM was defective and need to be replaced. Don‚Äôt they test the cars before selling them. I am so unhappy right now. I feel that this should never have happened. Used car , I understand but brand new car an explanation should be given."
Rogue,Cars,This car is awesome!  I love the ride!! I love the gear shift!  I love the comfort!   Lost some hatch but vehicle is awesome!!! 10 stars!!!
Rogue,Cars,This Rogue met all my needs. It is very comfortable to drive. I like that the rear door opens all the way 90 degrees. It has a great sunroof. Love it
Rogue,Cars,"A beautiful car, but with some annoying problems:
- Shaking / vibrating when driving or accelerating slowly. 
- The hand break stays on regularly when I start driving - for a few seconds, making the engine roar. Won‚Äôt get off even if I try to turn it off (and it is supposed to go off automatically).
- Stop hold feature: I love the idea, as I have knee problems and it releases tension in my right knee, but for some reason, when I stay on it for a while (e.g. at the drive thru), it doesn‚Äôt come off when I try to drive again. When this happens, I need to stop the car, turn it off, and  turn it back on... Can be dangerous in some situations. Also: the Cruise control with Pro Pilot is a bit scary, as when the car before me changes lane, it starts accelerating way too fast to reach the set speed now that the obstacle is gone. I usually turn it off to control my acceleration on my own. I was driving a 2017 Rogue before, and I felt safer in my old version, by far."
Rogue,Cars,I went with the new Rogue because of its updated  restyling and based upon Nissan‚Äôs reputation for  performance and reliability. I am looking forward to a pleasant experience.
Rogue,Cars,"This is by far the most advanced and tech equipped vehicle I've ever owned. Very good , well thought out features and roomier that previous models. Economical so far and very comfortable seating as well as driving. Excellent sound system."
Rogue,Cars,"I purchased this Rouge Platinum for a daily driver with good gas mileage. I am 6' 2""  my 6' wife and our kids are 6' and 5'3"" and we fit comfortably with no complaints. This is our fifth Nissan we currently on a 2019 Armada and I expect the same reliability that we have had with the others.   Coming for a lifted Toyota Tundra I can drive back and forth to work for almost 2 weeks on a site tank of gas as to wear the Tundra went through a tank a week. I can't say enough good things about this SUV."
Rogue,Cars,Crown Nissan is the best dealership and has the best vehicles. Love my new Rogue. All the features and comfort makes driving a pleasure. Easy to drive and rides smooth.
Rogue,Cars,It‚Äôs what I was looking for. An AWD that is comfortable and gets great gas mileage. Plus all the other great features the Rogue has.
Rogue,Cars,"It full film my requirements and features that I need to drive safe and comfort , on the road make me happy an like it"
Rogue,Cars,My wife loves her new Rogue. She says it has plenty of power and has a very smooth ride. She especially enjoys the sun roof which is a very nice feature on the car.
Rogue,Cars,This is my second rogue and this year the design has really improved. Quality leather good sound system the back up camera has incredible clarity. I am so impressed with all of the safety features. If I had one complaint it would be that the floor mats are not super durable. I would definitely upgrade or have them throw in an all weather mat. This car is very quiet and handles very well. I love the on the fly traction control for all types of weather. Too many good things to write about!
Rogue,Cars,"Hate the side mirrors, bring back or move them forward.
Bring back the movable rear seat. We used it pushed all the way forward for our dog.
Bring back the rear under floor storage, the same size as the 2018 model."
Rogue,Cars,I have been very impressed with the new Rogue.  I love the new features of this SL model and look forward to many years of problem free driving.  The increased size of the 2021 model provides many Murano like features at a greatly reduced price.
Rogue,Cars,"Had this car 3 months it‚Äôs my 3rd Rogue. Monitor not working, no radio, gps iPhone connect charging backup cameras, weird noise, flashing Nissan logo, it‚Äôs been 2 months, they cannot find the part anywhere! Nissan consumer affairs have stopped calling to give updates, but yet want you to pay your monthly payment for a new car that‚Äôs not 100%
Beware if you buy they cannot fix it, you‚Äôll be stuck with a LEMON!"
Rogue,Cars,Love the improvements made in the 2021 model year. Exterior is sporty and aggressive.  Interior is refined and well appointed.  Great easy to use features
Rogue,Cars,Traded my 2018 for this new design and interior concept. Love it. The 18 inch tires makes a smooth consistent ride. The design in and out is classic gold.
Rogue,Cars,"This car is perfect for me. The doors are tall and easy for me to get in and out of even with arthritis. It has a lot pep. The interior is comfortable. I love the changes on this newer model. Cup holders are more accessible,  the car is a little larger than previous models and the safety features are top notch."
Rogue,Cars,"I bought this car for the safety features. Blind spot warning, forward warning collision, rear emergency braking, rear cross warning, and more,

I really love all these features"
Rogue,Cars,"This car meets all my needs for roominess, easy to navigate. The only thing it's missing is a trunk opener on the fob. If it had that the car would be perfect."
Rogue,Cars,I chose this car because of the headroom when I got in and out of it. Car rides quiet and has all the accessories that I need.
Rogue,Cars,Car has many features that I was looking for.  Comfortable ride and easy to handle.  Controls are easy to reach and understand.  Video provided by Nissan is a great help in understanding the systems.
Rogue,Cars,This Rogue is the best I've owned and I can't wait to start driving it. It has all of the features that I want and need.
Rogue,Cars,I am currently on my second rogue. The first one lasted me 10 years with only normal wear and tear. This second one had me feeling equally as excited when I test drove it. So far it is more than  exceeding my expectations!
Rogue,Cars,This is so roomy and drives so smooth.  I love it.  It is a great color and so easy to drive and learn all the features!!
Rogue,Cars,"Problem with the AC, the temperature cannot be controlled, it comes out hot from the driver's fans and I took it to the dealer and they told me that it was designed to work that way, which is normal, it drives me crazy. I've tried to get the problem solved but until now they say it's normal and bought a dozen new cars and it's the first time this has happened to me with a 42-mile car"
Rogue,Cars,"Rogue with Platinum trim (top of the line) is beautiful inside and out. The backup camera with side and top view is a big help. Plenty of acceleration. Only driven 1,000 mi but fuel mpg is around 31. Disappointed that garage door opener wasn't included. Living in AZ, vented or a/c seats would have been great. Many helpful electronics. I would buy again."
Rogue,Cars,"It dies 3 times on us!  First time after we bought,  15 minutes away from the dealership. They allegedly fixed it.  2nd time, 20 minutes we picked up it died again for the same mechanical electrical issues!! 3 times is a strike!  After pick up again they told me a Nissan engineer worked on the car and it was SAFE to drive!!  It WASN'T!!! It died an hour later in a middle of an intersection where I almost got tbone by a semitruck!!!! Good Samaritans tried to moved the car from the road.  Not even the neutral was working!  It took several strong men to move it out of the intersection and calmed down until my husband arrived!  It was a horrible nightmare!  The dealership didn't take responsibility or ownership of the problem. So now Nissan Corp needs to do it right! We lost of trust!! You put me in danger!"
Rogue,Cars,"THIS TRUCK  TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO. HAVEN'T HAD A NEW ONE IN 14 YEARS,  LOTS OF BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT I WILL LEARN VERY QUICLY WITH MY HANDY MANUAL."
Rogue,Cars,Very dependable and love the leg room and the new wider doors. Overall performance is excellent. Interior design is very colorful and cargo space is what I needed.
Rogue,Cars,This car meets all my needs.  It drives so smooth and has all the items that I wanted.  The new design made me stay with the Rogue.
Rogue,Cars,"This car has lots of space and leg room.
The ride is smooth , quiet and has tons of safety features.
Overall very satisfied of the quality of Nissan Rogue!"
Rogue,Cars,It's enjoyable and fun driving. What can I say but a wise choice and the gas per gallon is a real plus out on the road
Rogue,Cars,"Love this car.  This is my 4th Rogue.  They are reliable and and great car
for the money.   Mileage for an SUV is pretty good."
Rogue,Cars,"I've owned a Rogue before and it was not near as comfortable and sporty as my new one.  Plenty of comfort, and get up and go!  And the gas mileage is much better this time."
Rogue,Cars,So far I love this car! It‚Äôs sporty and so nice looking. Fun to drive! Love the huge sunroof. Very comfortable and plenty of power.
Rogue,Cars,"It‚Äôs unique appearance, and quiet ride are quite impressive. The driver assist features, and technology, along with the front, rear, and 360 degree camera views are amazing. Did I mention the Apple Car  Play & stereo? Great decision!"
Rogue,Cars,"The 2021 Rogue is very smooth to drive and new features make it an awesome experience. 
The new all-around camera makes parking so easy it‚Äôs feel like freedom."
Rogue,Cars,"Before purchasing my 2021 Nissan Rogue SV I was driving a 2013 Toyota RAV4 with all-wheel drive. While the Toyota RAV4 was a good car the 2021 Nissan Rogue is so much better. The car looks good on the inside, looks good on the outside and I have gotten lots of compliments about it. It handles great and the pro pilot assist is awesome to use and the warranty is impressive. I would recommend it to anyone who has not driven this car to test drive one for yourself I believe you will be impressed to the point of buying one if you're in the market for a new car."
Rogue,Cars,"Can‚Äôt speak to reliability since I just bought mine.  It‚Äôs an SL AWD in Boulder gray.  I absolutely love it, maybe more than any car I‚Äôve ever owned - and I‚Äôve owned a lot of cars.  Styling is superb, comfortable, electronics seem great!  Love the lane departure warning/ assist.  The interior trim really looks like a lot more expensive car.  I‚Äôm male and I like that the new rogue looks a lot more aggressive, especially from the front.  Only option I generally get that this car lacked is nav, which I never used anyway.  I had not seen one of the 21 models until two days ago, really stopped me in my tracks.  Last thing I must say: when I shut my door, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot of effort and the door sounds a bit like a safe shutting.  Solid."
Rogue,Cars,"This car does everything well. It‚Äôs very comfortable and good on gas my only complaint is it lacks power. The seats are very comfortable, it‚Äôs very good on gas and the safety features are awesome"
Rogue,Cars,"The exterior is aggressive looking and modern.  The interior is full of high end tech, quality finishing and comfortable.  It's my wife's car, I am 6 foot and 350 pounds who loves his room and V6 engine.  This car has ample room for me and believe it or not, I am impressed with the efficiency of it's 182 hp v-4"
Rogue,Cars,"This is my 3rd Rogue! I absolutely love the Nissan Rogue! The 2021 design is awesome! Love it, love it, love it! Thank you Drivers Village Nissan/Heather C."
Rogue,Cars,"I love this vehicle. Handles easily. The front screen is great dont have to put my phone up anymore 
Apps viewable on screen.
Great space for kids and their luggage."
Rogue,Cars,"We sought after the champagne color and finally found one, It is a show stopper, we are previous Rogue owners and just love everything about it."
Rogue,Cars,"Inside and outside it is great. Inside a lot of space. Feels more luxurious than sport, nice features on the SV version, similar and some additional to the Rav-4 and some like the speed change behind the wheel as the lexus NX-300.
The autopilot that stays in the lane and adjust the speed to a slower front car. You only have to stay awake."
Rogue,Cars,"New design is classic and functional. All safety features I was looking for were standard and the 21 Rogue is comfortable and economical. The inside is roomy,  thoughtfully designed, and fun to drive. The safety features are impressive."
Rogue,Cars,I love the exterior of the car and the wheels are really awesome too!! The interior is very comfortable and the back seat seems very roomy too!! Can‚Äôt wait to know my car more !!!
Rogue,Cars,"Beautiful, roomy vehicle! Big vehicle, for  little money. This SUV has class written all over it! Extensive look of class and sleekness.  It holds stunning decor beautifully."
Rogue,Cars,This car is very spacious and comfortable. I love how they design the interior. My favorite part is the panoramic moonroof. It has met all my expectations.
Rogue,Cars,"The car is quieter and smoother riding than the 2018 Rogue I turned in. I love the features, although I'm still learning to use them."
Rogue,Cars,My wife owned a 2019 Nissan Rogue and I fell in love with the new design. It is an amazing improvement over an already great car!
Rogue,Cars,"I totally love my new car! They redesigned the 2021 Nissan Rogue, and it has all the features I was looking for in my new car."
Rogue,Cars,"We just leased our 4th Rogue - love it!! Comfortable, great on gas, easy to drive. Would def recommend! Not once have we had any weather related issues with this truck. The 2021 is so much fun to drive"
Rogue,Cars,Transmission CVT not good  most Nissan car now have Cvt not reliable. Very expensive to fixed .Same problem and Nissan don‚Äôt do anything about CVT .
Rogue,Cars,The car is completely comfortable and drives very well and it is easy to use and the dealership was very helpful and very easy to work with
Rogue,Cars,Awesome Best suv i ever drove from day one drove quite an amount of miles  that day to ride Very comfortable and an awesome ride
Rogue,Cars,"The 2021 Rogue technology is outstanding! The Navigation Screen is superb and the craftsmanship blew me away! I was going to purchase a 2020, but opted in for the 2021...Glad I did...it will be delivered to my home in a few days! I remain a Rogue fan as it just gets better and better."
Rogue,Cars,It's styling is average since all new vehicles this style basically look the same. It's comfortable and rides decent.. better than previous years. The shifter design is a ridiculous setup and unnecessary. The stereo screen design is just plain ugly and stupid. Totally ruins the interior look. Constantly wiping off finger prints. Sunlight makes it impossible to see. The vehicle is LOADED with a confusing menu. The Bluetooth doesn't shut up. It just keeps going on and on with jibberish when trying to make a call. Totally unnecessary. The upholstery design is decent with 2 tone style but the ugly cheap and horrid line pattern on the seats and doors is a down right afterthought. Also a laundry list of electrical and computer issues. The engine runs loud and sounds like an older diesel truck Don't be fooled by the new commercial on tv.. this vehicle has a long way to go to be average.
Rogue,Cars,"This car is smooth, comfortable, great 360* cameras. I love it. The two tone color looks sleek. The heated seats and steering wheel are so nice."
Rogue,Cars,I am completely in love with my Platinum Trim Nissan Rogue. It has all the bells and whistles in it and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! The Boulder Gray Pearl/ Black color is beautiful! I would recommend this car to anyone! Sooo happy with my car choice and purchase!
Rogue,Cars,Great technology in features provided. Styling is impressive. Car looks great both inside and outside. Pricing was very competitive when compared to other car brands with vehicles in this class.
Rogue,Cars,Review is for 2021 Rogue SL AWD with the Premium package. Looks - get the 2 tone it's so good looking and the body style redesign is fantastic. Bose audio is outstanding (only available with Premium or Platinum). Lots of tech... Be prepared that this vehicle is DIFFERENT. Driving is with a knob and more buttons and switches. This is my 3rd Rogue and I love them but you need to test drive it first to make sure you are okay with the new way to drive it! Cargo area is smaller than my 2018 but I'm okay with that... Lots of room if you fold down the back seats which is easier now. Divider between driver and passenger takes getting used to... Not sure if that's an improvement because the open space under the center divider could be easy to get your hand stuck in. The button placements are much better now but the start button doesn't illuminate so make sure you set your interior lights properly so you can see the button. Overall I'm really loving it but it might not be roomy enough for every driver.
Rogue,Cars,My new one has leather which allows me ease of getting in & out as I have a bad knee. It has so many safety features. Very very comfortable seats.
Rogue,Cars,"Beautifully redesigned,  very quiet and smooth ride.  Love the safety features,  great gas mileage.  The technology can be a bit intimidating at first but definitely worth the effort to adjst."
Rogue,Cars,"It is very comfortable. Love the heated seats and steering wheel. Very quiet inside. I‚Äôm most impressed by the safety features of the vehicle. Bird‚Äôs eye view cameras, blind spot notification, as well as assistance if swerving into another lane. Very excited about this vehicle."
Rogue,Cars,Just love driving this vehicle! It's so comfortable and easy to drive. Has all the bells and whistles I wanted in a car in Northeast Wisconsin - can't beat the heated seats and steering wheel!
Rogue,Cars,"This car meets all my needs. Has a good price, reliable, propilot assist, cameras, SOS. NissanCOnnect, Sunroof... many more feature for the MSRP. Will highly recommend this car."
Rogue,Cars,"This car exceeds our expectations and is a great experience to drive, the comfort is beyond words to explain. Sales person is a plus for your company."
Rogue,Cars,"Very well designed, with plenty of features included in a base price. Excellent value for the money. Performance is outstanding, comfortable, and quiet. The luxury feels and look for the competitive price."
Rogue,Cars,Some of the great features are more room for passengers plenty of storage. Easy drive overall comfortable.great color. Backup screen is very clear.If you have a chance to visit this your Nissan dearship test drive this car.
Rogue,Cars,Excellent car fully loaded good on gas it has remote starter heated seats sunroof nice rims my phone was very easy to connect all leather interior.
Rogue,Cars,This is my first car but I am so glad I got this one. It‚Äôs very nice and feels extremely luxurious. All the technology is easy to use and makes the car all that much better.
Rogue,Cars,"Yesterday (11/29/2020) my sister bought a brand-new 2021 Nissan Rogue. She was upgrading from an old Toyota Highlander and wanted a more fuel efficient SUV, and fell in love with the 2021 Rogue's styling. When she bought it she was impressed! I was told that Nissans last forever and I can agree as my dad owns a 2010 Frontier with 180,000 miles (11/2020) that still runs like it's 2010. We love Nissans! (Also, if you're going to write a review on a car on this site, please don't talk about the dealer, there is another section on this site that allows you to review dealers.)"
Rogue,Cars,"It‚Äôs early in my purchase, however I feel that I‚Äôm going to enjoy it.  It definitely has a lot of new features that I‚Äôm going to have to get familiar with."
Rogue,Cars,"I test drove the Rav4, CR-V, and the Rogue.  The Rogue blew away the competition so we bought it!  It's got the best seats, best interior, and quietest ride of the three.  Nissan really knocked this one out of the park."
Rogue,Cars,This car seems to have more room up front.   Very comfortable.  I like that the display screen is larger. The back up camera is clearer and easier to see
Rogue,Cars,"It has plenty of leg room specially for the person sitting behind me, the interior look luxurious, plus it come with a bunch of nice gimmicks you guys need to go and see this car me telling about it doesn't do it justice"
Equinox,Cars,"This is the third Equinox that I have leased.  Had a 2015, 2018 and now a 2021.  Great vehicle.  I love it.  Best decision I ever made."
Equinox,Cars,It has everything we need in it it is the largest vehicle I have ever had I usually drive Chevy cars but I am truly enjoy it and it fits all of our needs
Equinox,Cars,This car has all the options we were looking for plus more. It is comfortable and meets all of our needs. It is nice and easy to drive.
Equinox,Cars,"Great SUV with super tech components and seating!  Smooth ride, great pick-up, and a/c are perfect throughout the car!  Our first Equinox was Champagne color. Now we have Pearl Black! So sleeeek!"
Equinox,Cars,"This vehicle has some safety and comfort features that we haven't had before.   At first it seemed like chimes were ""always"" going off.  With some help from Hawkins Chevrolet staff, our salesperson Troy Sunken and another staff person Nick, I have learned to manage the chimes.  The mpg is better than any other Equinox we've had.   Overall, it is a great vehicle.   Our grandchildren said of the back seat, ""It is more comfortable than the previous one.""  So far we are very happy with our purchase."
Equinox,Cars,"This car fits my needs. I find it easy to drive and to park. The sight lines are good. It has good acceleration, and I like the interior design."
Equinox,Cars,This is the 3rd Equinox I have owned and the improvements they keep making are incredible.  I especially have always like the power lift gate. I will be an Equinox customer for as long as they keep making them.
Equinox,Cars,The suv is great. My dog has his spot already picked out. I love the room it has and it drives really nice. I love being able to see the road better
Equinox,Cars,I love everything about my new bowtie and very happy to have gone with a Chevy this time around.  Love the color ice metallic and love the blue jeans inspired interior and love how the body style is derived from the El Camino!
Equinox,Cars,"I have owned this vehicle for less than 2 weeks, so the car and I are still getting acquainted with each other. Although the ride could be more smooth, the car is performing well and I believe it is a good value for the price point. Key features  that appealed to me:  the car is easy to get in & out of plus the gauges & screen graphics are an optimum size for viewing. The car has ample leg room for both the driver and passengers. The Equinox is not too big or too small‚Äîjust a great Goldilocks size for maneuverability. Happy owner so far!"
Equinox,Cars,"Fun to drive, lots of great features, quiet cabin. Inside isn‚Äôt overly fancy, but functional. Turbo boost gives it a little more get up and go compared to other engines this size. Love driving again!"
Equinox,Cars,I absolutely love this car! I have never owned a brand new car and this one fits all my needs. Lots of room to put stuff for my toddler. Drives nicely
Equinox,Cars,This car is very unstable when driving.  I have previously leased a 2018 and a 2019 Equinox and was fairly happy.  The 2021 is a nightmare and the dealership keeps telling me nothing is wrong.
Equinox,Cars,"Looks great, meet all of our needs. Look forward to driving it on trips.  We really like the color and the way it handles on the road."
Equinox,Cars,I love the way you can see everything around him very little blind spots but I‚Äôm having a problem with my car engine light is coming on haven‚Äôt had it for about three months for some reason or another I‚Äôm losing power tried to go up a bridge and I could‚Äôve got out and pushed it up there faster somethings definitely going on I just don‚Äôt want to be called I‚Äôve been a lemon now I‚Äôm really worried about my car And when you push the gas it just loses power and jerks
Equinox,Cars,"Handles well, comfortable, roomy and easy to drive. Rides high up off the ground, while yet close to the road.  I am not sure about much else."
Equinox,Cars,"Show many new upgrades on the new equinox . It‚Äôs a beautiful car it‚Äôs so comfortable. It has a phone charging pad, navigation I got the leather package the seats are so comfortable I just really love this SUV."
Equinox,Cars,"This is a great replacement for a van that was now too large. Still able to carry 5 passengers in comfort. The van was good but no longer needed 7 passenger capacity.  Love the new features on the Equinox, still getting used to them. Great vehicle so far."
Equinox,Cars,"Plenty of room, everything easily within reach, lane warning, too close warning, back up camera, strong air movement from the ac, plenty of usable seat adjustments, gas mileage good."
Equinox,Cars,"This the only kind of vehicle I will buy. I have owned many in the past, never had problems. Recommend great family sized suv. Priced just right."
Equinox,Cars,"After owning my Ford Escape for over five years, I was in the market for a new daily driver. My husband had just purchased his first Silverado and we were in love with the Chevy so we went to check out a used 2017 Equinox. I loved it. The change of heart came with the amazing rebates that let me walk away from my Escape free and clear with ZERO negative equity. The Equinox has plenty of room for my quickly growing boy and husband who is over six foot tall. We took it on a trip a week after purchase and it was the best ride I think I've ever taken. I couldn't be happier."
Equinox,Cars,This car met all of my needs... very convenient and comfortable and easy to drive all power...and I got what I want for a car.
Equinox,Cars,We had to take it for service three times. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll cause us some more problems and will cost us money in the future.
Equinox,Cars,"The Equinox is very comfortable and easy to drive. It has great features for someone that has to travel a lot for work. I am pleasantly surprised, it was not my first choice prior to going to the dealership."
Equinox,Cars,"We bought a 14 Equinox in 2015. Very reliable vehicle, great gas mileage. Lots of room compared to the other crossovers we looked at. We knew what we wanted when we bought the 21 and we were not disappointed."
Equinox,Cars,This car is perfect for my lifestyle. I travel quite often and it is comfortable wi thg h plenty of space for my luggage. It gets great  gas mileage and is always reliable.
Equinox,Cars,"This car is absolutely AMAZING!! I love this car! It‚Äôs perfect for me and my kids! I love the smooth ride, I find myself feeling like a celebrity in it! It‚Äôs cheap on gas and all the fancy gadgets makes this purchase worth it!"
Equinox,Cars,"Due to services , I had also driven 4 different model of the Equinox. Each of the 4 were a little different, but i liked the size and models."
Equinox,Cars,"This car satisfies my needs.  It has enough bells and whistles to occupy my curiousity.  For a person my size, I find my vehicle very comfortable."
Equinox,Cars,"Car is performing great and getting great gas mileage, happy with our purchase. Has a lot of premium features, dual sunroof, leather seats, and premium paint."
Equinox,Cars,"The car has everything you need.  I am so excellent that I brought this car. Seat are comfortable, rides smooth.  You can talk about this vehicle  all day and night and still couldn't cover had nice it is."
Equinox,Cars,"So far so good.  I‚Äôve really been enjoying driving my new car. I have a lot to learn about it since the technology is newer than I am used to, but it‚Äôs very comfortable.  It feels safe and reliable."
Equinox,Cars,"So far we love our new Equinox, not too big, yet very roomy inside.  Many great features including lane change warnings.  The fit and finish is first-rate and the design is user-friendly and intuitive. All controls are within easy reach of the driver.  A good car for a good price."
Equinox,Cars,"Great look, comfortable, easy to operate and very impressed with 4 cylinder turbo. 
I opted for LS with conv. Package and was impressed with features and price!!!"
Equinox,Cars,"Love it so far.  Room, great gas mileage! It is exactly what I was looking for in an SUV without getting into a larger category of vehicle.  Great value for the money!"
Equinox,Cars,"Meets or exceeds all my expectations.  I drive a lot and I need a vehicle I can be comfortable in and that is economical, this meets both requirements."
Equinox,Cars,"I‚Äôve have owned  a Trailblazer, feel this Equinox is a step above. 
Once I get used to all the ‚Äúbells & whistles‚Äù it‚Äôll be perfect."
Equinox,Cars,"We were thinking about buying an Equinox for a while. After test driving it and seeing all  the technology that it has, really an easy decision to purchase a new one. Great looking car with great gas mileage and surprising  acceleration."
Equinox,Cars,This vehicle met all the specific and basic things I was looking for in purchasing a new SUV of any make or model. It was the only dealership in a 50mile radius of me that offered this particular model of an Equinox I was looking for 2021 Chevy Equinox Midnight Edition.
Equinox,Cars,Car was great lots of options that you would find on a car costing a lot more auto dimming head lights speed sensitive cruise control
Equinox,Cars,"This car has a very positive impact on our lives, truly beautiful piece of workmanship by General Motors, comfortable and relaxing to drive; be careful of what you sign up for during your purchase. Because of the Technical gifts in the car and no ability (tech) made the price jump considerably to ensure proper care of vehicle and handling of the tech side."
Equinox,Cars,I previously owned a Traverse and I wanted a slightly smaller car.  The Equinox meets all of my needs.  Extremely quiet vehicle.  I like all of the safety features
Equinox,Cars,Very nice handling and tons of room. Love the color and gets great gas mileage. Has tons of cargo room and was priced very reasonable.
Equinox,Cars,"We are enjoying our new Equinox. Love the styling. The storage compartment in the console is higher than in my last vehicle, so my elbow knocks into it when I use cup holders. This will not be a problem as I get used to it being there."
Equinox,Cars,It is the best vehicle I looked at and I love all its features.  Lots of leg room and cargo space.  It will meet all my future needs.  It is easy to get in and out of and this was a big thing for us as we age.
Equinox,Cars,This SUV has plenty of room for our family of four as well as diaper bags and a stroller.  We are pleased with the price as well as the interior and exterior appearance.  We would recommend this vehicle to family and friends.
Equinox,Cars,"For seen future lemon problems just like the 2010-2013 equinox and chevy will not stand by it Trust me.Have a 17 Arcadia that's heading that way now I own 2 Dodges too those are driven more than the Chevy's, they are trustworthy"
Equinox,Cars,"This car all of my dreams I‚Äôve never owned a brand new car lot of room absolutely love it 
Now I can a comfortable road trip"
Equinox,Cars,Well equipped. Car has a lot of safety and convenience features.  Driving is easy. Quiet and roomy . Good mileage. Pleasure to drive. Fits my needs.
Equinox,Cars,"Between the two of my choice and research; the Equinox was the higher rated in many areas, as well as lower cost.  And the Boucher dealership was friendlier and attentive compared to the other vehicle and dealer."
Equinox,Cars,I wanted a SUV many years ago.... I've looked at other vehicles over the years  but keep coming back to the Equinox!  I love the style and plenty of room for family. It comes standard now with all the newest safety features and is so reliable.  Technology is so easy to adapt to any phone Apple or Android!
Equinox,Cars,This car has all the features I was looking for. Very pleased with the AWD feature.  Like the color too. Handles very good and is comfortable to drive
Equinox,Cars,Love it.   Great on gas and so comfortable.   My son already has one and now my daughter may buy one too.   We havent bought a new car since 2005 so very happythat we chose the Equinox.  Great choice and great value
Equinox,Cars,"My previous car was a Chevy Equinox, never had one problem with it, but it was time for a new one, so I chose to purchase a new one, a lot of nice features and a very beautiful SUV"
Equinox,Cars,This car is stylish and I'm enjoying my comfort in it. Very pleased with my purchase. The alert you get when you get close to the vehicle in front is great.
Equinox,Cars,This car has saved our lives more than once and now I get the newer version. I love it! It is smooth and quiet. The higher trim level (LT) is spacious and I love the chrome accents.
Equinox,Cars,This vehicle is perfect for my husband & me. I am able to get through a lot of snow when we‚Äôve had snow. I have absolutely no problems getting to work everyday. I don‚Äôt slide around like I did when I had a front wheel drive vehicle. This is the 3rd Equinox we have driven.
Equinox,Cars,"For the brief time I have owned the 2021 Equinox(3 weeks) it has been good.  Gas mileage in 2wd is good and the battery is somewhat easily accessible.  Oil changes should be relatively simple as filter is easily accessed.  

  The ""advanced safety features"" are annoying more often than not and they will go off simply because a car in the opposite lane passes you.  As a result I have deactivated them all.

  Most can be permanently deactivated but the ""auto start/stop"" requires more effort to permanently deactivate.  Have yet found a way to remove the front camera to disable the most annoying safety features.   

The ""lane keep assist"" can be turned off but must be deactivated every time you start the vehicle, another reason I wish to remove the front camera entirely as I do not desire the subtle steering wheel impulses while driving on snow and ice.   

Overall the vehicle seems to have potential and if its reliability can match that of my 2004 Cavalier I will be very happy but I had the Cavalier for 15 and going so its a high mark I doubt the Equinox will reach."
Equinox,Cars,The car in the highest trim is well appointed with most creature comforts to make the car enjoyable to drive. I purchased it as a daily driver and to be towed by a Motorhomes.
Equinox,Cars,"The color and everything is just beautiful. Don't know why I never wanted a white car before!!!!!  Very smooth styling, makes me happy!  Husband now thinking of getting a match!"
Equinox,Cars,I absolutely love my new vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends and family members. It has a lot of room and is a beautiful color
Equinox,Cars,"Very nice suv with a very comfortable ride. It has a lot of features new to us but we are excited about them. We are also very impressed with the features of the blind spot, lane drifting and the headlights are so bright and automatically dim/bright."
Equinox,Cars,"This car is comfortable, has many luxurious features, and is very easy to drive.  All around, it is pretty much what we were looking for in a vehicle."
Equinox,Cars,This car checks all the boxes for me! I can haul things or just drive in comfort! It is a great car for hauling grandchildren or scrapbooking supplies!
Equinox,Cars,Car is very smooth doesn‚Äôt make any noise is the mpg is amazing overall drive super smooth I love that it has Apple CarPlay easy car to get into now with Blindspot good and sensors. I bought the LT trim level
Equinox,Cars,"This vehicle is great, It's not what I wanted to be in but with my situation, was all the dealership could get me. It is a smooth and nice ride and seeing 30 mpg is awesome."
Equinox,Cars,"Great vehicle! Lots of new safety features, great comfort, great performance. If there is any thing with I don,t know what it is. 100 percent satisfied."
Equinox,Cars,This is a good sized car for for seniors like me. It is easy to get in and out of and is easy to drive.
Escape,Cars,This car is sleek and stylish on the outside. The exterior hides a very roomy interior too. Every control is within easy reach and the interface wit Apple Car Play is easy.
Escape,Cars,"My car has a miss or jerk  at low mpr bad one.  Have taken it back to dealer 3 or 4 times, even left it there for them to drive a couple of days. They said ford was having problems with2021 escapes but there could not do anything until ford told them to .  This is my fourth escape and none of the others did this.  HELP"
Escape,Cars,"Beautiful car, very advanced safety features. a fantastic rear camera that I need because of some serious neck issues.  Just a wonderful car, I'm a long-time Ford owner."
Escape,Cars,We have had Escapes in the past and
Escape,Cars,For
Escape,Cars,The
Escape,Cars,Money they are one of
Escape,Cars,The reliable
Escape,Cars, Are we
Escape,Cars,Have
Escape,Cars,Owned. And
Escape,Cars,With the 1.5 liter engine it will be economical too!
Escape,Cars,"Escape SE AWD, nice car! Surprisingly peppy for a 1.5L 3-banger, and when in Eco mode, fantastic gas mileage. I like the safety features, especially the blind-spot monitor and the backup camera. Ford has put a lot of attention to detail and everyone who has seen it find it very attractive."
Escape,Cars,
Escape,Cars,"Comfort is a tad under par for me, as I am not getting any younger."
Escape,Cars,
Escape,Cars,"It's been about 16 days since I bought it, and I keep reminding myself that I'm not in a dream."
Escape,Cars,
Escape,Cars,"I was very pleased by the dealer's service as a new customer and they fulfilled each of my needs, and then some. I got a full-coverage warranty for six years for great peace of mind."
Escape,Cars,
Escape,Cars,Just plain fantastic.
Escape,Cars,Nice car.  This car has a lot of nice features and it is
Escape,Cars,very comfortable and easy to adjust the seat..    It gets good gas mileage.
Escape,Cars,It has  accelerates nicely. The steering  effort is very easy compared to all the vehicles I have ever owned.  It is easy to get in and out which is a major reason for selecting the model.  It corners well. It has lots of features -the heads up displays are a real plus.
Escape,Cars,I find the Escape to be a very comfortable riding car that has the capability of hauling lots of items in the back. The sun roof offers lots of light and fresh air.
Escape,Cars,I‚Äôm very pleased with it.
Escape,Cars,Great vehicle.  Like setting up high in car.  Easy to drive and handles well. Turns short easy to maneuver and drive.   Like color and interior design but temperature control should be on steering wheel
Escape,Cars,"Drove my 1st escape 170,000 miles with no issues. I just bought. 2021 Escape Titanium, fully equipped. A little bigger than my 2014. Better gas mileage. Very comfortable. Absolutely beautiful car."
Escape,Cars,"So far Im really surprised with the 2021 Escape in all my needs. At the dealer I test drove 4 2020 escapes and they all all had a jerky transmission shifting as so many people claim in the 2020 Escape. I test drove 2 - 2021 escapes and both shifted perfect So I ended up with the SEL model and so far hasn't had that problem, shifts very smooth and the 1.5L 3 banger really gets up and goes. All around driving MPG is getting better, Im at 24.9 MPG and climbing with 236 miles. Had a 2019 Jeep Cherokee before this and its much smoother ride, better mileage and quieter at highway speeds. I will say this comparing both, the Escape is much easier to get in and out of for a older person 88 years old, very short mother with a bad hip and shoulder. She use to have a rough time of it and she didnt want no help. The escape since is is about 2 inches lower in seat height and narrower in the door jam makes all the difference to her. Windows are lower too so she can see out better as well. I looked as MANY SUV's and my goal was to find a easy get in and out of, this was my only choice. There were a couple others made in South KOREA that would have worked for her but they were just to small for my needs. So if getting a new car or SUV is on your list this might be the one your looking for."
Escape,Cars,"Good car, but horrible dealership. Dealer never transfer the title, it has been a month since we paid. We are looking for a lawsuit for potential fraud."
Bronco Sport,Cars,Great and so far I have no regrets purchasing my Bronco Sport Badlands.   Better than I expected. Rides and handles well in the snow and torrential rain.
Bronco Sport,Cars,Loving it so far!! Very new tho. Can't wait to see what adventures I will be taking it on. Very comfy and has zoooom power.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I have told my husband, kids and fur babies that my Bronco Sport is at the top of my list now of things i love‚Ä¶They are now second, third and fourth in line‚Ä¶Just kiddingü§£ Totally love my new Bronco Sport and very happy we decided to trade in our Jeep Cherokee to buy it."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Great car, the tech is great too. With FordPass you can start it from your phone, check oil life, and see tire status. Great on gas, overall a great car. Go get one!!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,I have owned many vehicles in my life but the bronco sport badlands is by far one of the best most reliable vehicles I have ever owned.
Bronco Sport,Cars,Great to have the Bronco back in the lineup.  It is stylish and a great value. We love the four wheel drive options and the overall size of the vehicle.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Ford hit this one out of the park on looks.  I‚Äôve got the Badlands in Area 51 blue/gray and I‚Äôm getting a lot of comments, all good.  The interior is extremely well thought out with many useful additions such as:  hidden storage, clips, molle straps, lift gate lights and even a bottle opener on the lift gate.  Small touches really matter!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,I have always wanted to own a Bronco and I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed. Ford did their homework and did not disappoint. I love the way it drives and looks. I have received a lot of compliments on mine. Well done Ford!
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Great gas milage, reliable. Love the way it handles. Perfect for going off road to do birding and photography. Plenty of room for all my gear."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Car ride good for 3 cyl engine is a gas saver with power the only problem is going above 45 mph it has a wind sound in the rear window that even dealer ship can‚Äôt find what‚Äôs the problem, waiting for Ford to see what‚Äôs wrong with that noise."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"It‚Äôs only been a few days so far, and I‚Äôm still learning all the different functions, but so far so good. Really enjoying the new ride."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Ford what took you so long! 

I bought 2021 big bend Broncos sport. Wow I give this Broncos A plus. Great ride ,lots of room inside,great color ,great looks,lots of safety feathers and great gas mileage."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Fun, peppy and stylish. Many high tech and safety features. also a hoot to take offroad even if not an experienced off roader. Remote start feature nice"
Bronco Sport,Cars,This car meets all of my expectations and is super cute fun to drive reliable and has a lot of features. Very comfortable and roomy
Bronco Sport,Cars,"The Ford Bronco Sport is a great vehicle! It has a sleek design, is extremely roomy and comfortable, and handles beautifully! This Bronco was purchased for our daughter and she absolutely loves it! Extremely happy with this vehicle!!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,"My Bronco Sport has exceeded my expectations and am so pleased with our decision to purchase it.  It is smooth to ride in, fun to drive and gas mileage is awesome.  We are looking for new road trips weekly just to get out and drive."
Bronco Sport,Cars,Got the Badlands model and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Has plenty of power and the extra traction options are great and the safety options are real nice.
Bronco Sport,Cars,This car was definitely an upgrade from what I had. It has some great features and looks super awesome! The technology is amazing with remote start and diagnostics from my phone and the different G.O.A.T. modes.
Bronco Sport,Cars,This car is a real head turner getting a lot of compliments from others that see it.  It is very sharp looking vehicle and a break from the cookie cutter looking SUV‚Äôs that are predominant on the road
Bronco Sport,Cars,For the highway or the mountain trail this vehicle suits my every need.  From the  comfortable ride on the highway to the down and dirty mountain roads the vehicle performs extremely well. I really enjoy driving the Bronco Sport.
Bronco Sport,Cars,My Bronco Sport is a smooth ride and is very fuel efficient. I love the Eco Boost. It has plenty of room and  great features. The sporty exterior design is a real head turner.
Bronco Sport,Cars,Over all the car appearance is stylish. The performance of the engine is great and handling is fine. The interior design of Bronco Sport is top notch.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"This Bronco Sport is a good looking vehicle, has everything I wanted, a good engine, accessories  and the right size for me and my needs.  I‚Äôm looking forward to driving it during our Michigan winters!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,This is the first SUV I have had as my commuter vehicle. I absolutely love it. It is rugged and totally built Ford tough for real.
Bronco Sport,Cars,It surprised me .. the comfort comfortable ride. I put over 500 miles on it the first week. ( and my wife really likes it.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned,, it met all my expectations and then some, the head room, the leg room, the comfort and overall performance, Ford hit a home run with this baby Bronco."
Bronco Sport,Cars,Good gas mileage.  More options than I will use.  It is a fun and cool looking vehicle.  It certainly gets a lot of looks from people.  I have also received a lot of complements on my vehicle.
Bronco Sport,Cars,Car is great.  Excellent gas mileage for an suv.  Plenty of storage room for size of vehicle as well.  Rides better than an old Cadillac.
Bronco Sport,Cars,This is a GREAT vehicle with many great options and totally fun to drive!!! I highly recommend it great on gas mileage and the bomb on sportiness
Bronco Sport,Cars,"We set off in search of a used F150 and bought one. While waiting for our out of state paperwork the dealer lent us a Bronco Sport. Well, that was it, game over. We ordered one the way we wanted it not too frilly.
  Styling and build quality is outstanding. Hard to believe its a 3 cylinder?! You wouldn't even guess, its got plenty of pep for a fairly heavy little goat with good mpg. I didn't understand the marketing having two types of Broncos at first but actually its genius. A wrangler pick up makes as much sense as a 4wd el camino after all.
 Pricing was very fair even at full msrp! 1st new car I ever purchased that was worth the same as when I drove it off the lot as had offers for it even then. No! Its mine!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Awesome car.  Nothing I don‚Äôt like about it!  You‚Äôll fall in love too.  Beautiful design, roomy, handling is excellent.  Color I got is called Area 51 and trust me, it‚Äôs gorgeous!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I bought the Base model, which means not top of the line in terms of comfort (think cloth seats and manual seat adjustment vs leather and push-button), although perfectly acceptable for the price point. It handles well, good acceleration, feels roomier inside than you would expect for a smaller vehicle and looks good. Since I've only had it 3 days, I can't really assess reliability yet, but there wasn't an N/A option."
Bronco Sport,Cars,It‚Äôs a Small suv. Great on gas. Pick up is pretty good. Looks amazing. Priced a little bit high in my eyes but didn‚Äôt stop me from buying.
Bronco Sport,Cars,more interior room quieter ride excellent response seats more comfortable  lots of bells and whistles but very user friendly overall its a better  suv than the Cherokee Trailhawk 2015 that I traded for
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I have had my Badlands with the 2.0 engine for a month now. I look for excuses to drive it. Great quiet ride, excellent acceleration, beautiful leather interior and ready for serious camping! Ford thought of everything when they designed this car, down to the built in bottle opener in the back. The Area 51 Blue color is gorgeous as is the up graded leather interior. Gas mileage is incredible, I use the normal mode, would be better in the Eco mode. My only complaint is, dealers need to have a sit down class to learn all the electronics in the car. The manual is over 400 pages and not to clear in sections in my opinion. Not everyone is a computer nerd. Congratulations to Ford engineering, they hit a grand slam home run!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Great suv comfortable and roomy, has a lot of power for a small engine .Paint  job is great ,blue leather interior is a nice touch .All around I‚Äôm very happy with it."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I was blinding by the popularity of this truck, I am not going to lie.
I LOVE how the Bronco turns heads & that there are not too many on the road.  My Bronco came with drama like most things that are popular do. One dealership told me the three Broncos that they had were not for sale & that I was not able to even test drive them, I thought ""WHAT??"" 

Then it became a vendetta to own a Bronco. When I finally found a dealership willing to let me test drive one, I don't know if I was more about getting a Bronco by any means  at this point or if I really liked it.

I purchased the base stock example model with 2435 miles on it, so I figured it had been broke in some.  What was included cloth seats *not heated, weather floor mats, *no XM radio (which drives me crazy on my long drives) *no tinted windows (the dealership tint my windows). NO PUSH START, Key FOB. :-(.

Now I have 5,895 miles on it. This car at first glance looked just like my 2006 Honda Pilot, but smaller. I have so far had to take it in for a recall: *""for the rear suspension modules that may not be fully secured to the subframe, which may increase the risk of an accident. The defect: rear suspension modules with loose or missing bolts.""""

So in the service bay the Bronco goes, the dealership took over three hours to look at it. While waiting for service I overhear the worker say, ""I don't even know what to look for"". After three hours I was told ""ok it looks good"".  I had doubts.

Now I hear this rubbing noise in the back like a howling  could it be the rear breaks? (Thought not this early no way.)  Another thing happen that alarmed me, my lights inside/outside all came on & stayed on & then I was not able to turn it off with the key fob, I had to put the key in the ignition to get the car to turn off the lights. 

I don't know if it would run down the battery or not, but for a new car I was alarmed. I plan on calling the dealer for another service date. I am  planning on trading this in for the ""REAL BRONCO"" not totally in love with my Sport AKA the Little Sister Bronco."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"It ride very smooth, the shadow black color gets tons of compliments, feel very safe in it.  The trunk has great space and a nice wipeable layer."
Bronco Sport,Cars,Test drove prior to purchase and enjoyed the comfort and gas mileage.   Staff very friendly and nice to work with.    Will go back with any further purchases
Bronco Sport,Cars,We‚Äôve had this car for a week and it has been a very fun car to drive.   The pickup in it for a smaller engine has been better than expected.   My only knock would be the steering wheel isn‚Äôt as nice as I would expect in an SUV in this price range.  Overall very happy and impressed.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"For those looking for a Bronco....keep looking. This is for the suburban Disney dads who almost bought a mini van and refers to ""him""self  as a ""diy kinda guy"".
Really disappointed in a vehicle that had some grit to be just a typical ""I wear north face and love kayaking with my beard and skinny jeans"" kinda of suburban dad."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"This is the first new car I have owned, and I love it! It is sporty, like a little Tank, and the headlights are awesome. It looks a bit mean and intimidating coming at you! Interior is great, very functional. Perfect for pushing through the snow and all my off roading!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,The car gasket all my needs  .I am able to drive  in snow easily.  Handles great and  gas mileage is incredible  . Makes easy for road trips
Bronco Sport,Cars,I had it for 1 week the low oil pressure light came on. It's been at the dealer ship for 11 days cause they have to get the diagnostic tool In for this vehicle. It's coming from Mexico but because of the weather in Texas it has delayed the part.  I'm over waiting.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I purchased my Bronco sport last week and it has been the easiest transition of my car buying life. It is smooth , pretty, peppy, and all around a great suv. The value is unmatched, ford was very thoughtful in the design. I'm 6ft tall and have at least 6 inches of head room which to me is a big bonus. I could go on and on about the things I love but to sum it up I'm very pleased with everything this vehicle brought to the market."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I've traded in a Mercury Mariner Hybrid that had 238K miles and I own a 2018 Escape.  The Bronco Sport sits higher, which gets me out of oncoming lights in my eyes,  it is quick and it looks fantastic."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I'm mostly posting this because it doesn't seem to have happened to anyone else. Completely dead and locked up, even the keys stuck in the ignition. 

Ford knows it's electrical. Bought it 3 weeks ago, put about 700 highway only miles on it. Sat all day Saturday, tried to leave Sunday and the instrument panel is dead and won't even attempt to start. 

2021 bronco sport base model.  Was very nice.
Will update when it's solved."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"I've been waiting for the Bronco to come out for years and I have to say I was a little disappointed when I checked it out. I did not test drive or purchase this car so my review is NOT based on the performance. I looked at the Bad Lands and the Big Bend.

First thought of the Ford Bronco Sport is that its sporty looking, what was Ford waiting for? I popped the hood and it seemed wonky coming up like the hinges would give you a problem if you off roaded your SUV. Next would be the interior, I looked at the Big Bend and the Bad Lands and I was so sad to see how cheap it felt inside. It had lots of head room and leg room but the dash, console, and plastic door panels felt like it would not last long. I wish the center console were bigger for more shoulder room. Did I mention the cup holders? There weren't many and none that would fit a large cup or bottle.

II liked the engine bay, it would be easy to work on this yourself if that was ever needed. The seats had a neat feature with zippers and molle loops in the rear. The overall look is great! 

I will consider purchasing one next year if some interior features are updated."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"At long last it has arrived!  We ordered our Ford Bronco Sport Badlands Edition in Kodiak Brown back in July/August.  It just arrived to our local dealer last week and now sits in our driveway.  Love the styling; it really feels much bigger than it is when you are behind the wheel.  As someone who is 6'3, I do feel comfortable with head clearance and room within the front.  No other vehicle within this category accommodates.  The backseat is tight in terms of leg room for adults, unless one moves up the front seats.  All the technology and creature comforts blend well with the rugged/beefy look of the vehicle.  We haven't gone on a long drive yet, but already I am so much happier with this as compared to our 2014 Jeep."
Bronco Sport,Cars,Went to go buy one after months of waiting and what a disappointment. Sooo small.  Teenage girl car.   Have seen 3 on the road in the city since I drove it and all have been driven by girls.
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Very capable crossover vehicle. Great looking exterior with a surprisingly comfortable and roomy interior. Multiple USB ports and wireless pad for charging your phone. Ford sync is the best car / phone sync I have used.

Four wheel drive is great so far for Seattle area rain. Have not used it yet off road, but there is not anything that tells me it won‚Äôt be capable."
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Wow! I went in to my local dealer kinda sorta interested in one last week. After the test drive I was instantly sold on it and had it delivered to me on Saturday AM!

So far I‚Äôm loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It‚Äôs a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I‚Äôm not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven‚Äôt seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I‚Äôm not crazy about, it is the ‚ÄúAuto-Stop‚Äù function that shuts down the car at lights. I‚Äôm really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven‚Äôt used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I‚Äôve mostly stayed in ‚Äústandard‚Äù mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I‚Äôm not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles. 

Super stoked that I was able to get it soooooooo easily and quickly when I‚Äôm seeing online that a lot of people are having trouble! I looked at one on Tuesday and they had me the model I wanted delivered to my work on my break Saturday! Paperwork took 15 minutes...they drive my trade in away and that was that!

Absolutely in love with it so far!"
Bronco Sport,Cars,"Love the 2021 Bronco Sport Big Bend edition! Has a great look and wonderful performance. So glad Ford reintroduced the Bronco after 24 years in hiatus. This is the first Ford I‚Äôve bought in over a decade, but couldn‚Äôt resist the new, stylish Baby Bronco."
CR-V,Cars,"liked my 2018 cr-v better only because  the gas mileage was fantastic. hopefully more miles on my 2021 will make it better. overall, 2021 vehicle was a tad better. if all things are status quo i'll probably get another cr-v when i'm ready. Mohawk Honda was fairly easy to work with"
CR-V,Cars,"Love this little car.   Ride as good as a BMW we had.  Gas mileage better than expected, would like better way to have backup key."
CR-V,Cars,"Excellent vehicle.  I was driving 2018 Honda CRV Touring.  Enjoyed this vehicle.  Normal service, gas mileage were as promised.  Comfortable driving.  My wife and I shared the same opinions in owning and driving a CRV Touring, we purchased a new 2021 Honda CRV Touring."
CR-V,Cars,"The styling, handling, comfort and features of the Honda CR-V are top notch. It is the safest car I have ever owned. Mileage is averaging 30 city and 38 highway! Smooth ride, modern controls and plenty of room. Honda has risen to the top of the class in SUVs."
CR-V,Cars,The exterior is sleek and the red CR V color is an eye catcher.  The interior amenities are abundant and standard on the vehicle.  I couldn't ask for more !
CR-V,Cars,The truck is very nice beautiful love the room heated seats and the sunroof push start just a nice truck I love it my first truck I ever had as mine
CR-V,Cars,This is my second CR-V and I had an HR-V previously. I am very pleased with the performance of this vehicle. I purchased the EX-L  model and very happy with it.
CR-V,Cars,This is a great little car at a reasonable price. Before we decided on Honda we looked at many other SUV type makes and models. By comparison we felt the Honda CRV gave us the most for the best price.
CR-V,Cars,"Love my car!! its so roomy, comfortable, and reliable!! Love the smooth ride, color, interior, and all the features!! My first new car, and I love it!!"
CR-V,Cars,This car meets my expectations and then some. Love the standard heated seats!!! And the blind spot notification. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúboxed in‚Äù like I have in other vehicles.
CR-V,Cars,"One of the best values around, the staff at Frank Brown Honda did an amazing job making the process simple. The 2021 CRV EX is - very reliable and comfortable vehicle."
CR-V,Cars,"So far so good! The CRV EX is roomy, has plenty of get up and go and is a great value for the money. The only feature I wish it had is the power lift gate but for the money , not a dealbreaker. It has ever other feature you could want!"
CR-V,Cars,Love my new car.   The salesman and the dealership were very helpful and patient and answered all of my questions.   I've owned Honda's for over 30 years and continue to be impressed by their value and reliability.
CR-V,Cars,We chose this car because it is spacious and comfortable for a car in this qqqQeclass. The interior is very attractive.  I am happy we
CR-V,Cars,"Reliable, plenty of room, stylish, and AWD.  Needed a car we can count on for our daughter whilst at nursing school in Rhode Island.  We have purchased Hondas for the past 30 years.  Still driving a 2005 Accord.  Brand you can trust your families safety in."
CR-V,Cars,Only been a few day but I am very impressed. Drives great and handles very well. It fits 5 peopl with plenty of leg room
CR-V,Cars,"I‚Äôm so happy I upgraded my CRV to the touring model. It‚Äôs a wonderful car. It may not be larger than the EXL model but it feels bigger and more substantial. So far, this has been a perfect car!!"
CR-V,Cars,It was exactly what I was looking for in a smaller SUV. I chose the touring version because I really like the extra touches and accessories that it offers.
CR-V,Cars,"This vehicle as met all my needs and more, plenty of leg room and cargo space to hold any thing you need to transport and I love it"
CR-V,Cars,"This car met all of my needs, Plenty of POWER...COMFORTABLE and ECONOMICAL and nice size for parking in NYC! The Touring Model has all the bells and whistle you'll ever need!"
CR-V,Cars,I haven't purchased a new vehicle in 20 years.  This car is perfect!  I've had a 2012 for lots of years and this vehicle is more than I could ask for.  I love it!
CR-V,Cars,I‚Äôve owned CRV‚Äôs before so I‚Äôm a third time repeat buyer. They have always been good cars and they get me through northeast Ohio winters safely witch is a big deal for me as I am a nurse and drive a lot.
CR-V,Cars,"I love my new Honda CR-V . It is so comfortable and has such a smooth drive!  It also has great gas milage which is important to me because I do a lot of driving! I really love this car and know I will enjoy it for many many years!  My last Honda has over 200,000 miles and now my Mom is driving it!  HONDA's are GREAT!!!!"
CR-V,Cars,"The acceleration overall is good, but for some people would be a little sluggish. The infotainment could be more user friendly, but I love the safety features of the EX and they are well worth the extra money. Why they put automatic seat controls only on the driver's side is perplexing, but not that big of a deal. The cargo space is great, and is the main reason I went with the CR-V. The CR-V is easy to drive and the Sonic Gray paint is georgous! The difference in technology between my 2015 Honda and the CR-V is remarkable. You can't go wrong with a Honda."
CR-V,Cars,This car is perfect for me and I love driving it.  It includes all the features I wanted and it was simple to navigate through the Honda Link system.
CR-V,Cars,"I have had a Honda Civic and recently purchased my third CR-V. Love the styling, the comfort and the feeling of safety when I am driving it."
CR-V,Cars,"My first Honda. Love it. Felt comfortable first time I sat in it. Taking awhile to get used to all the electronics (my other car was 10 hrs old)

CR-V,Cars,"Have only owned our new CR-V for a day, but loving it so far. Very comfortable to drive. It‚Äôs nice and spacious, great trunk space.

Tomorrow will be the big test, as I‚Äôll be taking our dog for her first ride!"

CR-V,Cars,"This SUV met all of my needs. It‚Äôs very spacious and comfortable riding as a driver or a passenger.  Great on gas. Quality, cost of ownership, and Reliable is what I was looking for and exactly what I got after signing my paperwork and driving off the car lot."
CR-V,Cars,This vehicle is a great combination of economy and room for shopping and carrying things you need on a trip. The visibility is awesome. And it is very quiet.

CR-V,Cars,"This car meets all of my needs, I enjoy driving it and love all of the features.  Love the moon roof, tinted windows, body style"
CR-V,Cars,This vehicle is very similar to the one I traded in for it with the exception this one is All Wheel Drive. I had nothing but praise for the vehicle I traded in and I expect this one to be the same.
CR-V,Cars,"Has all comforts, USB cable, roof top window,  leather seat, wide space for legs, stereo sound is excellent. In general worth of buying. Can fit in small gap."

CR-V,Cars,Great road handling and speed pick up when merging into traffic. Very easy to control and a very enjoyable driving experience. Would recommend Honda to everyone.
CR-V,Cars,Love the handling and the drive. What is best about Honda vehicles is the MPG. Probably the best in the industry.  Also love the color and added detailing. Superior selection for the price.
CR-V,Cars,"A lot to learn with all that‚Äôs on the screen it just takes some time .
The cat works fine my wife didn‚Äôt hear the difference until I pointed it out"

CR-V,Cars,"Great car, long time Honda owner, owned Toyotas, Fords,Jeeps,Chevys, and several other models but can't beat Hondas for comfort, reliability, quality.  All Honda dealerships have excellent service departments especially ""Honda Of Covington (Louisiana)"""

CR-V,Cars,Pleasant to drive. Controls are easy to use. Seats are comfortable. No passengers so far but I think they will be comfortable. Visibility is good.
CR-V,Cars,I love Hondas.  This is my 5th brand new Honda & 3rd brand new CR-V.  Engine is emitting fumes into cabin & gas going into oil badly.  Honda cannot diagnose.
CR-V,Cars,Honda CRV's have been my vehicle of choice for over 25 years and my new 2021 meets all my requirements.  They have always been excellent all around vehicles.
CR-V,Cars,"I have been driving a Toyota Rav4 since 2007 which is a great testimony as to the reliability of that car, (166,000 Miles), but.....the New 2021 Honda CR-V is just plain awesome.   The EX model has all the safety features that I wanted and the technology really personalized this car to fit ME.    I highly recommend this car as it has about everything one could want.   From the lumbar driver seat to the bluetooth integration of your phone and google maps, its all there.   You will not go wrong purchasing this vehicle."

CR-V,Cars,"I am a long time CRV owner ( I previously owned a 1998 and still owe a 2009). I have watched the design change over the years. I  don't like the engine idle feature nor the design of the console. Being a woman, you like to have your purse close, in my prior CRVs I could have it next to me on the floor, now I have to put it in the back seat. I have been able to drive my previous vehicles for over 200k miles that's why I've stuck with the CRV line. I hope that for my new 2021."
CR-V,Cars,"After owning Civics and Accords, I decided I needed something a little roomier, so stepped up to the CR-V.  It doesn't disappoint.  The ease of driving and seeing cars around you  is excellent.  I feel very safe in my new Honda CR-V."

CR-V,Cars,This met all the requirements that I wanted and has the room that I wanted but most of all is higher and bigger than what I had.
CR-V,Cars,Hondas are great cars.  This is my 4th Honda.  All of which where excellent cars. Never put expensive repairs on any of the cars I've owned.  Two of my previous cars were kept for 9-10 years each.  I plan on keeping this new for at least that long as well.
CR-V,Cars,"If you need an small SUV that‚Äôs full of latest gadgets/features even from the lower trims,if you‚Äôre looking for fuel efficient rather than powerful engine then this is for you too.If you are a driver that is used of driving power engine cars,this is not for you.I highly recommend to those people who drives 4 cyl vehicles and those who are looking for efficient not super fast cars.So far,i‚Äôm very happy with my purchased of this vehicle."
CR-V,Cars,We love the style and all the options it came with. The all wheel drive and Honda sensing will be loved by my wife.  Very pleased.

CR-V,Cars,"This is my fourth CR-V (1997, 2005, 2016, 2021) and the nicest one yet.  Comfortable interior, nice ride, all of the safety/sensing features standard, and plenty of amenities for me."
Tucson,Cars,"Overall, I am happy with it.  I also have an older Santa Fe, and wanted to try a smaller SUV. I think I would go back to the bigger one on my next purchase. Otherwise, the car has been great for all the other categories. Third Hyundai and it is of good quality like my previous ones."

Tucson,Cars,"Bought my new Tucson and within 2 weeks took it on a road trip from Rio Rancho, NM to New Orleans and back. The car performed beautifully under various weather conditions, from hot and dry to cold and hellacious rain.

Tucson,Cars,"This vehicle has been subject to a safety recall for 7 months. Dealership says there are no parts to fix it, but I'm ""on the list"".

Car with an acknowledged safety issue that Hyundai will not fix is in my mind unreliable, and a poor value for the money."
Tucson,Cars,This car is amazing !! It has all the latest technology . It drives smooth and helps you drive smooth. It has many safety features and a lot of xtra things you didn‚Äôt know you needed .
Tucson,Cars,"After looking at many small suvs, the Tucson was by far the best option for options, looks and value and lets not forget Warrenty. We worked with a great dealership and staff that had a great selection and was very good to deal with which made us happy to believe service will be great also."

Beautiful color.  Drives like a car but all wheel drive.  Love it!!"

Tucson,Cars,Love the many different features one of my favorites is the Bluetooth features also the backup cam drives nice I feel more safe in this car considering my old car needed some work it was paid off didn‚Äôt want anymore car payments yet but fell in love with this vehicle
Tucson,Cars,The car is to small very little leg room for tall people and not much space for carrying big items no fogs lights not a family car.

has more features than all the others for a
great price.  The longer warranty is also a
nice feature."
Tucson,Cars,This vehicle fits our current needs as we are retired living on a fixed income. Very comfortable and all the excessories we need.nice looking vehicle.
Tucson,Cars,I love this SUV. I  guess it is considered a smaller scale SUV but you would not be able to tell from the inside. There is so much headspace and leg room! I love the way it handles and it is very well made.
Tucson,Cars,"After considering other similar models from other manufacturers and different sizes from Hyundai, we chose the Tucson for value and design features. I really love it so far (only a couple of days). This is my first Hyundai and I am very happy with my purchase including the process with the dealership and the vehicle."
Tucson,Cars,"So far this vehicle has all the features I need, handles well and gives one a good view of the road. Gas mileage is also pretty good,"
Tucson,Cars,Great suv. I have enjoyed driving it so far. Plenty of room. Looks great. Good value for the price. Would recommend to friends and family.
Tucson,Cars,"It is a very nice car for the value!!  Lots of bells and whistles technology wise.   I returned my Grand Cherokee lease and decided to give it a try for the last month.  I purchased the Ultimate trim with AWD.  It‚Äôs a very comfortable car and drives fairly smooth considering the driving conditions I‚Äôve dealt with the last few weeks(heavy snow/rain).  In the snow, it handled pretty well, I did hear some snow scrape underneath but that was because of the lower clearance.  The handling is pretty good and responds well.   The gas mileage is okay for a 4 cylinder, I avg about 22.5.  The sound system is very nice but I feel that the way the entire radio system/screen works will take some getting used to from my previous car.  When I helped someone move, the cargo capacity with the rear seats folded down was equal to my grand Cherokee as I was able to fit 9 boxes.  The little downfalls with the car aren‚Äôt a deal breaker to me but might be important to others.  There are no memory seats.  The 4 cylinder acceleration isn‚Äôt impressive but does as it is needed.  And possibly the one thing I do find someone annoying is the key itself.  The buttons are very very sensitive!  I‚Äôve found myself getting into my car on several occasions with the key in my pocket and I somehow am opening up the tailgate.  I‚Äôve also once activated panic alarm unknowingly.  This alone in my opinion can be something that maybe Hyundai can modify in the future.  But all in all, for the cost it‚Äôs a very good car and I would recommend it.  

Oh, the type of driving I do is commuting to queens from Long Island, as well as commute to NJ."
Tucson,Cars,The new model is very nice. I just wish the automatic trunk option was included with the newer one. I miss having that feature already
Tucson,Cars,"I‚Äôve only had the car for one week so really can‚Äôt give an honest assessment. However, the Hyundai has all the features I was looking to get in a new car."
Tucson,Cars,"So far I have no problems with the vehicle.
I was use to driving a car..So driving a SUV is different.
But it's a different experience for me..
But I'm going to enjoy my SUV.."
Tucson,Cars,"I‚Äôve wanted the Tucson for quite some time and finally decided to purchase it. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! It‚Äôs stylish, roomy, comfortable and drives like a dream."
Tucson,Cars,"It‚Äôs my second time at this dealership and my Second lease with Hyundai.

I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my choice. 
4 years ago I was a proudly VW driver and after reading about Hyundai car‚Äôs and its amazing reviews I decided to trade in my GLI Jetta for a Tucson AWD.
the car drives nicely, all features and convenience packages were included with the model, which made my decision easier considering everything this car had to offer was a add-on at other brands...
Extremely satisfied with the value for the money. And after 3 years I‚Äôm back at the same dealership to lease another Tucson. Trust me you won‚Äôt regret it."
Tucson,Cars,"This car meets all my needs and beyond . It has plenty of options LCD display Navigation, safety features enough leg room, seats 3 in the back and much more"
Tucson,Cars,"There was no design change for my new Tucson as the 2022 were not in dealers yet. But I didn't have a problem withe the 2018 design, so I got the 2021. Beautiful exterior color red."
Tucson,Cars,This car meets and exceeds all my expectations!  Very Comfy.  I hear it has great leg room in the back (I don't know from experience cause I am the driver!!!!!!)  Getting use to back up camera - and I love it!   Awesome that it pairs with my android - and I can listen to audio books on my drive to town!  Very peppy for a 4 banger.
Tucson,Cars,It is all I need for my family for traveling recreation and pleasure and I enough room for sport fishing and I am hitting the road very soon
Tucson,Cars,"Best suv i have ever owned. Great ride and comfortable. Low maintenance great on gas great performance on the road.will buy a Hyundai again gr
Eat suv"
Tucson,Cars,I test drive 6 different cars from various dealerships and always came back to this one. For the same price it just comes with so many more features
Tucson,Cars,should have upgraded to one with automatic passenger seats.  Only problem. Likes the way it handles on freeway..   Has a comfortable ride. Both my wife and I like driving it.
Tucson,Cars,"I love my Tucson Hyundai so far! It has a lot of great safety features and drives very well. Very spacious and comfortable, I can see myself driving this car for a long time"
Tucson,Cars,I would not buy another   Heater does not wor on feet. When I use window washer I get bad smell. Gas mileage is terrible. That is all.
Tucson,Cars,I like my new tucson overall. Handles great and had plenty of features. It does lack in the fuel economy department though but I am not too concerned.
Tucson,Cars,Very nice SUV that has a lot of comfortable upgrades. Handles well on the freeway and has plenty of safety features. Heated seats are a real plus and I would highly recommend that upgrade.
Tucson,Cars,Love it great car great size  Will be too big for me to drive that is awesome perfect match picked out a blue but as soon as I get changes colors it‚Äôs weird but it
Tucson,Cars,"It's well designed and can't beat all the features on it for the price.  It's fun to drive, has good leg room in the back and good storage in cargo space."
Tucson,Cars,Every thing I was looking for and more.  The car rides good and there‚Äôs a lot of room. The car has so many standard features.
Tucson,Cars,This is the perfect upgrade for our granddaughter and her family. Previously owned an Elantra. The Tucson is roomy in front and back and has a roomy cargo bay. The ride is smooth and quiet. This vehicle came with many standard features not found on other vehicles. . Safety is our primary concern and this vehicle meets and exceeds our requirements.
Tucson,Cars,This Tuscon has all the features that I wanted in a car. It was fairly easy learning about all the features that I use. glad I chose it.
Tucson,Cars,This car drives smooth and I feel comfortable and safe while driving it. I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting stuck in the snow this winter.

Tucson,Cars,I am excited to drive my new car. It has exceeded my expectations. All the new safety features are amazing. I am very pleased with my new Hyundai.
Tucson,Cars,Well made comfortable with that in mind I like the Tucson and and and the deal was one of value. Thank you for helping me with my car selection.
Tucson,Cars,I had a Kia Sorento but decided to downsize.  I still wanted an SUV but wanted something smaller.  I dealt with Kurtland Sliski and he put a great deal together.
Tucson,Cars,"It's been exactly a week since I leased my Hyundai Tucson SE. So far I am loving driving this SUV.  I has almost all of the bells and whistles that I wanted, but it has all the bells and whistles I need. I am looking forward to many great years with this SUV. I'm really happy."
Tucson,Cars,"I Love it, the set's can be Adjust up or down. when you turn on you signal light to get over it let you know if its safe or not"
Tucson,Cars,The backup camera is amazing and large! Makes for parking with ease! The blind spot markers are great and easy to see. I love the blue link which comes in the car where I can start my car with my smartphone from my job without having to go outside into the parking lot.
Tucson,Cars,Very excited with my choice!  Just what I was looking for!  Great teamwork at the dealer Napletons Hyundai. They will make you feel important & walk through all with you.
Tucson,Cars,Love it as a second suv.  It was between this and a car.  It seems to be very comfortable and easy to drive.  We leased it for 3 years.  So far we love it.

Tucson,Cars,Its the perfect size for me and has all the options i need in a car.  The safety features are great and they're what i looked for in a car

It has the blind spot alert, alert if something is crossing behind you, front seats are heated. Digital AC."
Tucson,Cars,"I love this car. I've only had it for a few days, but this is my 3rd Tucson. I compared this vehicle to the new Forester, but found the Tucson had more for less. Beautiful on the inside and outside."
Tucson,Cars,"Needed to move down in size, we did the research, got plenty of recommendations, and waited for the best deal on a new vehicle in our price range"
Tucson,Cars,Greatly improved vehicle . Better interior and exterior. Good leg room and more safety features. I highly recommend this vehicle. Very comfortable ride and very quiet.
Tucson,Cars,Love the charging station and the panaramic camera. Nice features all around. The color is exactly what I was looking for and the nheated steering wheel is going to be so nice in the winter.
Tucson,Cars,So far the Tucson is terrific .... drives smooth and comfortable .... good on gas mileage and just the perfect size for my wife...Love it!
Sportage,Cars,"Would not lease another one. No spare tire- not even a donut.  
No jack. 
No automatic tailgate.  No way to pop tailgate from inside vehicle. Since it is important to me, I should have asked about tailgate, but no spare?
Brother supposed to get spiff for  referral.  6 months, nothing."
Sportage,Cars,"It's a great car as long as you don't have any noises from motor after the first 500 miles and is getting  louder, the dealer won't replace any parts in question high pressure fuel pump follower, or a possible  timing chain tensioner.  Warranty department is yet to be desired on this issue but could just this kia dealer.  Love the kia sportage and  fun car to drive"
Sportage,Cars,"The true litmus test will be on an upcoming 2 - month road trip, otherwise, I just have driven it much but so far I'm pleased"
Sportage,Cars,"I love the sporty look. Every time that I look at it I can't believe it's mines. I wish it had automatic start and the trunk lift with the remote but I know I can't have everything. I love the drive modes the lane assist, cruise control, camera, sound of the music, the color, etc. Just overwhelmed and always looking forward to driving it again."
Sportage,Cars,this car met all my needs with room and leg space along with the extra ubs cable hook ups i can also hook my phone and tablet to it
Sportage,Cars,My kids (who are still in car seats) and I love it!  The space inside is very spacious and we feel fancy as my daughters said.  The panoramic sunroof really adds a great vibe. The pearl white is gorgeous.
Sportage,Cars,"Drives well, smooth, and quiet. Has plenty of pep, just enough bells and whistles to make the drive enjoyable. Love the sporty look of the body style!"
Sportage,Cars,"I got exactally what I asked for.  The car is perfect. Love the Pacific Blue. i 
Love the SX. Have owned Sportages for 25 Years. Never have I had an issue with them. None."
Sportage,Cars,"Perfect for me, small, all wheel drive, and extra comforts, this is actually my second time purchasing a sportage and my third Kia. Reliable and good price"
Sportage,Cars,This car was very dependable clean and sheep the moon roof was amazing üëèüèæ I would definitely buy this issue we but I would never purchase it from Casey kids go anywhere else just not to Casey key.
Sportage,Cars,"Love the look,comfort...it's just a sharp and everything that you could want. I love the leather interior, the space and the ability to haul or for camping trips and you never know when you will have to go off road but at least you know that you can if needed!!"
Sportage,Cars,It meets all my needs I love it. It rides great. Love the color. It gets great gas mileage. The salesperson that helped me was great.
Sportage,Cars,This car has all I need with the exception that it doesn't have a CD player. Got it because I will need all wheel drive soon.
Sportage,Cars,"Love everything about it. It's small enough so you don't feel like you're driving a tank but roomy enough to ensure everyone has a comfortable ride with plenty of room left over for all your stuff. The ride is extremely car is gorgeous inside and out, and the ride is incredibly smooth. The sound system is very important to me, and this one does not disappoint.  For the price, you cannot beat this vehicle."
Sportage,Cars,"I really like the ""cockpit"" of the Sportage. Everything is at your fingertips and easy to see and read. It rides beautifully and looks great."
Sportage,Cars,It was exactly what I was looking for in this size  suv nice features interior well made awd worked great in a 14 mile  trip in constant rain gas mileage could be better I got 27.5 from South Carolina to upstate New York less with awd I‚Äôd still buy this model again
Sportage,Cars,"Perfect car, Plenty of room, excellent gas mileage, and tons of safety features.  Love the electronics that came with the car! You get a lot for your money with a KIA and a longer warranty than anyone else."
Sportage,Cars,Comfort and style. My son who is six foot six fits comfortably and love the space he has.  Such a smooth ride and the seats are fantastic.  Love the back up camera!   Thank you Gary.
Sportage,Cars,"This is my second Sportage. We love everything about it except the gas tank door. The old manual design was better. With this new automatic door, you have to remember to make sure it is closed 100%. If not, the mechanism does not pull it shut every time. Even my dealer doesn't like it."
Sportage,Cars,"This car is great size for my son and I. Easy transition from a 2018 to a 2021. Rides great! Great interior, easy to use touch screen."
Sportage,Cars,"The car has all the bells and whistles.  Except for the GPS in the dash, it is wonderful.  The problem with the GPS is YOU CAN'T SEE IT DURING THE DAY BECAUSE OF TO MUCH LIGHT coming through the windows: but, you can hear it. The other thing is you can open the back with remote but cannot close it except manually."
Sportage,Cars,"Unbelievable car..... I love everything about it looks great and the functionality is endless, it's comfortable,  beautiful and quiet  drive,  love the uvo up...... its the best"
Sportage,Cars,"I would highly recommend a visit to Seelye Kia if you are interested in a new or used car.  The staff was professional and educated on their product offerings.   The Kia Sportage S has all the options I was looking for, the Sports package is comfortable, stylish, and full of bells and whistles I did not have in my Toyota.  I could not be happier with my decision to purchase from Seely Kia in Kalamazoo and absolutely love my new Kia Sportage S."
Sportage,Cars,"I downsized from a2018 Sorento LX and I like the Sportage S better. More comfortable seats, close to the same passenger space. Android auto works beautifully. 18 inch wheels make for a nice ride. Plenty of safety features... daytime running lights, blind spot monitor, along with a 5 star crash rating.  Black cherry with dark wheels looks great."
Sportage,Cars,"Not only does this car meet my needs, but exceeds them in comfort, 'bells and whistles', gas mileage. What a GREAT vehicle. Just the right size, just the right pep, well - just the right everything!"
Sportage,Cars,"Happy with my decision to purchase a Sportage. I like the safety features, the comfort, the ride. So far all good. I only have car a few days, I'll know more the more I drive it"
Sportage,Cars,This car is the car i never see my self leaving. My Sportage Gets all the attention Rides and feels Great and is not the regular Honda and toyota you always see around i had a CR-V and i hated it i also drove a toyota  tucson worst mistake i ever did traded out of it in 2 years.
Sportage,Cars,Very sharp looking.  All electronic features.  I don't like that there's no cd player in the vehicle since I own a big collection.  Color listed on reg was wrong.
Sportage,Cars,"The car is great so far. My only concern is that it has less cargo room than my previous vehicle.
Comfortable to drive and looks great."
Sportage,Cars,"I drive 70+ miles a day on highway. Safety in snow is amazing. Beautiful, sporty SUV, highly recommend. Tons of room for Family and luggage / groceries. Awesome warranty!"
Sportage,Cars,"This is our 3rd Kia and it's been just as great as the last two. The quality and reliability are second to none. 
Highly recommend!"
Sportage,Cars,"It's just what I needed comfort wise, dependability, looks.  I felt very safe when driving in this deep snow.  It took me right up the several steep hills that I must use to get into Mansfield."
Sportage,Cars,"The. compact SUV Kia Sportage is so huge on performance, comfort and reliability to the point I had to purchase another one.This time I upgraded to an S to increase the comfort and overall driving experience as I drive for  a living.  With its V6 engine as opposed to a 4, you have a smooth ride, adjustable seats, seat warmers and fell like you are in a luxury SUV instead of a compact! It has 3 adjustable drive modes (I like the Sport mode option) My first Sportage had turned 10 years old and still going with nearly 250,000 mikes on it! So worth your investment! Go test drive one and you won‚Äôt regret it!"
Sportage,Cars,"You feel like riding on a cloud.  If you get stuck in winter snows, this vehicle is wonderful in the snow and my kids love the reclining seats..."
Sportage,Cars,I upgraded my car from a 2016 Soul to the 2021 SportageBest decision I made by getting this vehicle. No high pressure sales or hidden fees
Sportage,Cars,So far so good.  Brand new owner less than a week and less than 100 miles driven so far but love the features (that I've figured out so far...need to work on studying the manual...lol)  Great double sunroof and navigation system.  Love the wireless charging pad too.  This KIA Sportage is a very fine vehicle!
Sportage,Cars,Estamos muy contentos con nuestro nuevo veh√≠culo. Tiene todos los adelantos que nosotros est√°bamos buscando. Queremos recomendarlo a nuestras amistades. Era nuestro deseo de ser propietarios de un Kia.
Sportage,Cars,This is the second Sportage we have owned.  The size is perfect.  Plenty of leg room.  Love the multi-purpose screen on the dashboard.  Has plenty of pick up and go.  Easy to maneuver.  Great car
Sportage,Cars,Not worth the money I payed could of done much better elsewhere should of gone with the Chevy Equinox like I planned always go with your first choice
Sportage,Cars,"Downsizing from older Sorento, this sportage is just the right size. Just as much legroom, spacious, better on gas, easier to park. Great family size vehicle."
Sportage,Cars,"I just finished out my lease of a 2018 Sportage and leased a new 2021 Sportage. I absolutely LOVE this car! I especially like the look of the grill and rims on the newer model!!! It is a beast in the snow. I also love the new,  standard features like Android Auto!"
Sportage,Cars,This car is comfortable. It has plenty of room.  The interior is beautifully designed. It has two USB ports. The dash is easy to learn.
Sportage,Cars,"The vehicle definitely meets our needs for comfort, safety, and handling.  It has plenty of room for our family and we love the stylish looks.  This is the 3rd Kia we‚Äôve owned."
Sportage,Cars,"this vehicle  fits all my needs. And I enjoy driving it! If you want a sporty car, but don't want to break the bank this car is for you."
Sportage,Cars,"This is my third Sportage SX, never a problem, fun to drive, best value in the market. I love the performance, and like my first two SX's I know it will be trouble free."
Sportage,Cars,I love my Kia Sportage.  It has great gas milage and is comfortable riding.  It has many safety features and a large back up camera screen.
Sportage,Cars,So far I'm still learning about the beauty of my kia sportage. I'm excited about what I will discover it can do. And I'm looking forward to taking my lady on a ride.
Sportage,Cars,"I love everything about it. I love the style and all the essentials that come with it. I just love it! Touchscreen radio, hands free phone calls and its all wheel drive which what I need, because of where I live. Need it for the snow."
Sportage,Cars,The car suits me well. It‚Äôs comfortable and fits week in parking spots. It also drove great in the snow we had last week! So far I am very happy with this car.
Sportage,Cars,"It is very nice comfortable and roomie
Like the color rides smooth , just your basic car nothing fancy  nice features
Gas is great I this car"
Sportage,Cars,"I love the way this car responds. It‚Äôs roomy, it responds immediately and hugs the road. I love all the features and it‚Äôs super safe. The features like heated steering wheel and seats for winter and ac in the summer is great. Handles like a dream. Very responsive and reliable.  I can fit a ton of stuff in this car. It‚Äôs amazing. I just replaced my other Sportage with the newer model. Really good gas mileage, roomy and lumbar support makes long drives a piece of cake."
Sportage,Cars,Met all of my needs and drives like a dream.  It is smooth driving down the road.  Love the navigation system and the radio.  It os wonderful.
Sportage,Cars,This purchase was perfect size for me and my 2 kids!!!! I see a lot of road trips in the near future! Thanks for making a great vehicle!
Sportage,Cars,My car is fully loaded and it is beautiful (and RED!). It is very comfortable and drives very nicely.  It was hard to say good-bye to my 2012 Kia Sportage but this one is amazing.
Sportage,Cars,"This is a beautiful, well performing, comfortable,dependable vehicle. Best one so far!! Very roomy interior. Beautiful outside color and interior. My second Sportage and I absolutely love it!"
Sportage,Cars,It is an excellent vehicle.  Love the style and over all performance.  It handles great with all the safety features as well.   Love the color.
Sportage,Cars,"Lots of room..... the style is amazing, inside and out, and it handles very well on the road..... would recommend a Sportage to anyone..... Especially an EX !!!"
Sportage,Cars,"Love my new Sportage Turbo, has all the bells and whistles on it.  It almost seems to drive itself. Love the guys at the Kia dealership, thanks for all the help over the years."
Sportage,Cars,"This vehicle is quite comfortable and drives so smoothly and responsively.  The interior is very roomy but still has the feel of a snug sports car. I couldn't be more pleased with the feel, the handling and especially the looks. The Nightfall package is really sharp and I've noticed several years turning as I drive past.  I couldn't be more pleased."
CX-5,Cars,This car is so comfortable. QUIET! And stylish. I put a lot of mikes on my car and I want my commute to be quiet and comfortable and fuel efficient. This car has ALL THAT and enough power to pass on highways. The all wheel drive makes the car stick to the road in rain and snow.
CX-5,Cars,I enjoy owning the Mazda CX-5. I previously had a 2018 Acadia.  The CX-5 is smaller but I find the trunk space has adequate amount of room for items. Since I did not need a 3rd row rather I needed a car with more trunk space this car has worked nicely. The only change I had to get use to was being closer to the ground as the Acadia is higher up. That hasn‚Äôt been too bad of an adjustment.
CX-5,Cars,"I bought the Grand Touring, and it‚Äôs got everything I wanted in a new vehicle. Meets all my criteria and expectations! Still finding options that I didn‚Äôt know I had!"
CX-5,Cars,"After owning several Honda‚Äôs we wanted something with more power and a more luxurious interior.  The CX-5 turbo has met or exceeded our expectations.  If you are considering a CX-5, I highly recommend getting the Turbo AWD model."
CX-5,Cars,The dashboard design is the best I‚Äôve ever driven.  It‚Äôs comfortable.  It‚Äôs fun to drive and I‚Äôm hoping it has great reliability as the reviews say.
CX-5,Cars,It‚Äôs zippy and holds tight to the road while offering finishes that are downright sexy. This is not your average mid-size SUV. The stitching alone separates it from its competitors and the Bose sound system is on point.  The tech is on par with any luxury vehicle I‚Äôve driven in the past.
CX-5,Cars,"I traded my 2020 CX 5 for a 2021 and so thrilled with the newest model. They have refined the screen, tweak the transmission to where it‚Äôs really a joy to drive now.  The styling is great. It‚Äôs not too big, not too small, just right."
CX-5,Cars,"I owned a 2012 CX-9 for 5 years, and was quite impressed with its reliability, handling, and overall performance. This led me to consider the 2021 CX-5. I spent a considerable amount of time researching the professional reviews. I test drove one, the competitors, and decided it would be the best value for the money. I purchased a red touring, beige interior with AWD, and the 2.5 187 HP power plant. Not only is it stylish and fun to drive, it's safety ratings,  exterior and interior features give me a feeling of confidence. Room is a bit less but adequit. The interior is linear and well balanced. The 10.25"" infotainment is easy to read, but not user friendly. The ride is comfortable, stable, and QUIET. I'm 5'11"" and slide into the cockpit comfortably ready for take off. With sensible driving and 750 miles, mileage is well above 30 mpg. I would highly recommend the CX-5 for a small family, or a single person."
CX-5,Cars,"Only owned the car for 3 days. It drives and rides great. It is very luxurious, like a more expensive car. So glad I chose this vehicle."
CX-5,Cars,"This car is GREAT. Drives smooth, great pickup for the engine size, crisp interior, stylish exterior. The audio is crisp and when I put the seats down I can camp in the back (I'm 6' tall)."
CX-5,Cars,This car is spacious for a small family of four to five and convenient to drive and there is a lot of horse power when you needed
CX-5,Cars,I love it and get a lot of compliments on it. I will continue to deal  with Mazda in the future. I recommend this dealer to anyone.
CX-5,Cars,"Love the CX5, and now with the Turbo engine, it definitely has the Zoom-Zoom factor. I bought the Signature trim which has the Napa leather interior, very comfortable and I love driving it."
CX-5,Cars,The Mazda CX-5 is well designed and the electronics are user -friendly.  It‚Äôs also easy to drive and comfortable.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable and impressive looking car.
CX-5,Cars,This car is perfect. Plenty of leg room in the back and trunk space. I really like all the sensors.  Lane assist is awesome.  And a great back up camera.  Love my new car.  Sales rep was very kind and helpful.  She made the process so easy.
CX-5,Cars,"Had the car for 4 days and so far, it has exceeded our expectations.so many safety features and entertainment options. Handles great. Happy with purchase"
CX-5,Cars,"I purchased the Mazda CX-5 Carbon Edition in early May - I could not be more pleased with my purchase. The paint color is unique and eye catching, and the interior is on par with vehicles that cost $15-20K more. The CX-5 has plenty of room in both the front and back, and it has ample trunk space. At this price point, there is no competitor that comes close to matching the CX-5."
CX-5,Cars,"This CX-5 is my fourth; this Mazda is my seventh. My 2019 and 2021 CX-5s have the all-around safety features. I won't drive a vehicle without these. The CX-5s are comfortable, stylish inside and out, powerful when you need it, reliable, great on gas mileage, easy to handle. No better vehicle out there -- for the safety and money."
CX-5,Cars,"Perfect size, smooth drive, definitely stylish. This vehicle is equipped with so many features. This one‚Äôs a keeper!
I highly recommend stopping by your nearest dealer and taking one for a test drive."
CX-5,Cars,"This car is a dream come true for me. It has plenty of fun entertainment features to make me happy without overwhelming me with too much on my dash at once. I test drove a Rav4 and while it was a nice car as well, the dash reminded me of a space ship b/c there was so much going on at once and I struggled to even locate my current speed amongst everything else. With my Mazda I can opt to keep it simple or put more information up on my dash as I want and the speedometer is never part of that particular part of the dash area so no worries about not knowing how fast I'm going. it has wonderful cruise control features that make traveling long distances on the interstate a dream come true. It's stylish and comfortable with plenty of room. The front seats recline almost to a full lay down position which is an awesome feature for me since I enjoy napping in my car on my lunch break sometimes and it makes it so much more comfortable that way. The trunk space is plenty roomy for a small family with no kids, or one kid, and i love the one touch open and close feature. the backup camera is like watching a hi-def movie it's so clear and the safety features with the lane assist and even coupled with the back up camera sensors to warn you if someone is coming along your sides that you can't see quite yet, can't be beat. the back seats can fold down in three seperate ways so that you have versatile options for transporting larger items that won't fit just in the back hatch. I've had this car for about a month now and I don't have anything bad to say about it honestly. I love everything about it and I used to loathe driving and now I love it thanks to Mazda and my CX-5."
CX-5,Cars,"I bought the Signature edition and I love it!  There are so many safety features and it has higher ground clearance than my Honda CRV.  That is important in snowy Colorado. Plus, it's fun to drive!"
CX-5,Cars,"Mazda has one of the highest, if not the highest,  safety record for SUV‚Äôs. I trade vehicles every 2-3 years, this is my 3rd Mazda, it‚Äôs the best vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned."
CX-5,Cars,"I own a Mazda 2016, and it‚Äôs the best car I have ever owned.  So naturally I wanted to stay with that model, just wanted an upgrade."
CX-5,Cars,"Good looking, reliable, great performing vehicle. And oh so comfortable. Better than great sales experience at Wantagh Mazda. It‚Äôs got every feature you need and a few you never thought of. Very enjoyable car."
CX-5,Cars,Interior and exterior are  elegant and sporty. Gas mileage is exceeding expectations now and the high tech features are fun and useful! Very quite rude!
CX-5,Cars,"Love this car.  Bought the CX-5 Grand Touring with Premium Package and it has all the bells and whistles that I was looking for.  Love the Parchment color leather seats too. The exterior color, ‚ÄúSoul Red Crystal Metallic‚Äù is stunning."
CX-5,Cars,I was confident  that I  would  like this car and I  do.  Seems a little bit roomier  which is good and the exterior  styling  is very appealing.   It looks like it could handle any road conditions  without sacrificing a safe and  comfortable  ride.
CX-5,Cars,"It came with everything I was asking for, it's great on the road. You'll love the flexibility if this vehicle. My favorite thing, cooling seats, don't get me wrong I love everything about it,  but those little things make a difference."
CX-5,Cars,I went from test drive to ownership in one day. This a great performing suv it really accelerates well and also handles well. The other thing this car has all the safety and convenience features as I purchased the signature edition and it‚Äôs worth the extra cost. The ride is a touch firm but acceptable for the handling it provides. This is one of the nicest cars I‚Äôve ever purchased and they ar numerous.
CX-5,Cars,This is my second Mazda CX-5. I love the car and it amenities. It is fun to drive and has good pickup for highway driving
CX-5,Cars,Lots of features. Comfy. Good looking. AWD is great. Priced about half of what a comparable high end brand would be with the same features
CX-5,Cars,"As many of the car magazines will tell you, there is nothing in the small SUV class that can compete with the CX-5.  The car is head and shoulders above everyone in driving dynamics. The interior finish is on par with other vehicles $10K more expensive.  
If you're thinking about buying and Audi, Mercedes, or BMW, try the CX-5 (in one of the higher trim levels) first.  You're going to be shocked"
CX-5,Cars,The Mazda CX-5 CE is a beautiful car with luxury and performance . I just got it but the interior is wonderful and the safety features are super helpful. Zoom Zoom!
CX-5,Cars,"I reviewed this car on another popular website. I wanted to give more details here. Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."
CX-5,Cars,"Has excellent design inside and out, plus fabulous power and reliability. It is comfortable, smooth, yet very strong. Wish it had better gas mileage. I'd recommend it w/o a doubt, and Valley Stream Mazda was fantastic dealership for honesty and best deal too!"
CX-5,Cars,"Not as good as we had hoped, I could change gear in a manual gearbox car quicker than this car changes, also for the money not at all good value, sad to say we are already talking about changing it for something else."
CX-5,Cars,EVERYTHING OUR SALESMAN MIKE HEINTZ FROM WERNER MAZDA IN MANCHESTER NH SAID WAS TRUE. THIS VEHICLE HAS MORE STANDARD OPTIONS THEN MOST OTHERS . IT IS LUXURIOUS WELL BEYOND ITS PRICE RANGE. DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. MAKE SURE YOU TEST DRIVE THIS ONE
CX-5,Cars,We were looking for an all wheel drive vehicle. We test drove the CX-5 and really liked it. It rides really nice and has a lot of safety features.
CX-5,Cars,"This car has a high end style and color, it is All Wheel Drive for the traveling I am going to be doing. My car has the latest equipment, the newest safety features and accessories I want and enjoy in my car.  The seats are very comfortable and easy to adjust.  The steering wheel can be set for comfort by pulling it out or pushing it in or moving it up or down.  The steering has the controls for phone calls, cruise control and safety features with car distancing and the car has so many more features that are too numerous to mention.  It is a great driving vehicle and excellent value for the money!"
CX-5,Cars,"I ended up spending a bit more and upgraded to Grand Touring Model of Mazda CX 5. Heated seats. Heated steering wheel. Moonroof. Leather interior. Very nice drive. Extremely happy with it. Only small caveats were I wish just a bit more leg room in the back seat without adjusting the front 2 seats forward.  If you floor the accelerator, the vehicle jerks a bit. Minor complaints however. Overall, very, very satisfied with the vehicle. I bought a red CX 5 and the color is awesome!!!"
CX-5,Cars,"This SUV is spacious, the body of the car is luxurious, and the gas mileage is awesome! It drives like a dream and I love all the features that I can use right from the app."
CX-5,Cars,This car feels like a sports car! It handles like you wouldn't believe and is an incredibly smooth ride! It has all the features of a luxury car without the luxury car price tag!
CX-5,Cars,Car is a rhe smoothest car insurance have owned and is super reliable on the road. I would recommend to anyone who needs a new car..
CX-5,Cars,I love everything about my new car! My first time purchasing a brand new vehicle! The best experience. I would pick my mazada over the infinity fx35 that I previously owned any day.  When it comes to all the safety features Mazad out did themselves.  You can't go wrong with a mazada!
CX-5,Cars,This my 9th Mazda from Tustin Mazda and   I‚Äôve used Larry Henderson as my sales guy almost every single time.  He really goes to bat for the customer!  This 2021 version  of the cx5 is so quiet and smooth and the screen is hi tech without being too complicated to use.  Treat yourself to one now!
CX-5,Cars,"This car is very similar to the car I had, my 2014  CX 9 which was totalled in an accident 2 mos prior to this purchase.  Although I don't have that third row of seats, Its still very roomy, comfortable  as much as my CX 9 was, yet more up to date, loaded, with amenities.   I love the UPGRADE!"
CX-5,Cars,"This car drives really well, and has an interesting color on the exterior. The interior red leather is also very pretty and the various mechanisms and accessories are very well designed. I need to learn how to use the electronic attachments."
CX-5,Cars,Nice ride and quiet on the road. Turbo feature provides a quick response when passing. Interior features are exceptional and nice Bose sound system is a bonus
CX-5,Cars,"I only have two issues that I would like to address. I am unable to use my steering wheel controls to scroll my Sirius/XM favorite channels. I am hoping that Mazda can come up with an update that will change that. 2nd- It would be nice to be able to control the cabin temperature from the My Mazda app.  Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase. I have had the vehicle 1 week today."
CX-5,Cars,"Quiet, fast, luxurious, affordable, great finishes. Loving the interior and exterior details. So far, we love this car.Very spacious inside. Really loving this cute SUV"
CX-5,Cars,"This car has the premium feel of my last luxury car purchase, at half the cost. I want to drive a vehicle that is safe and practical for outdoor activities while having a nice-looking car. Easy to say that a Mazda CX-5 fits that description."
CX-5,Cars,"It is very responsive with the wheel and gas pedal and brakes.  I especially like the large 10.25"" Infotainment screen.  The design exterior design is very attractive with a slight agressiveness to the front grill. Nice.  Feels very solid, especially when you open and shut the front hood.  Heavy but in a good way. Top of the chart for impact ratings in its class!"
CX-5,Cars,"Fun to drive. Reliable, luxury, great value, safe car. I enjoy driving it every day. Enough space for my family with two kids. I think if more people test drove it, there would be more Mazdas on the road."
CX-5,Cars,"I love this car! It has all the goodies and feels like luxury vehicle with all the extras that came with it. My only wishes would be for automated folding mirrors, a larger moonroof, and roof rails. The ride is smooth and super quiet. It feels SOLID. The leatherette is very comfortable and I feel cradled in the multi adjustable seat. I love that the passenger seat has the same controls. It is a joy to drive and I look for opportunities to take it out on the road. This is my third Mazda, and I really appreciate the value and quality this brand delivers."
CX-5,Cars,I was looking for an SUV that was higher off the ground than my sedan and has a quiet cabin. This Mazda CX-5 filled those needs. I was happy with the interior styling and the quality of the upholstery. There is good storage but it could use a larger cubby in the console for placing small items like my phone. Not a deal breaker. Air conditioning and heat are excellent. Audio and integrated Apple Car play are very good.
CX-5,Cars,"This is my 5th Mazda and I must say, Mazda gives you a ton of amenities for a reasonable price. The new turbo engine give the car some added pep. The handling is superb and the turn radius is phenomenal. The interior cabin is well appointed and has all the bells and whistles found in high end luxury vehicles. The new Nappa leather seats are a dream to sit in. All in all it's the best deal out there for a mid size SUV. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this vehicle."
CX-5,Cars,i like it. it is quicker and quieter than the previous one i had. that was the 2017 model. the star review shown above should have a very good star. the car is very good
CX-5,Cars,"This car meets all my needs.  It has a great exterior design, very comfortable and sporty interior.  Amazing Bose sound system and very roomy and lots of trunk space!"
CX-5,Cars,"This is my 2nd CX 5 - with new 7th generation technology Mazda has outdone even themselves. Great driving position, fabulous road manners and perfect size. I am extremely pleased with my 2021 CX 5."
CX-5,Cars,"We have owned Mazda cars for years, we traded a 2016 CX-5 for an updated 2021 CX-5... Our dedication to Mazda is a reflection of the great service Orange Park Mazda provides.."
CX-5,Cars,"Look no further! This is it!! Stylish, roomy, comfortable, GREAT gas mileage!! A smooth ride ( we have the Grand Touring) and we couldn‚Äôt be happier!!"
CX-5,Cars,Once again Mazda has nailed it! The CX 5 is great value. The interior and all of the features are things you would only expect is far more expensive luxury cars. Handling and overall driving experience is great!
CX-5,Cars,The car is beautiful and comfortable. It has great technology and the Bose radio is uncredible. The led headlights are very bright. Car rides smoothly.
CX-5,Cars,"Just leased my second Mazda, a CX-5 Grand Touring (base trim - no Prem Pkg) and I'm pretty pleased so far. Having come from a 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5's ride is a bit on the firm side, but is fine. The non-turbo engine is surprisingly peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The smartphone remote feature, 10.25"" info screen and upgraded infotainment system are welcome additions, albeit one too many steps needed in the infotainment to execute relatively simple tasks. The one feature I'm disappointed with is the Bose system. It has decent sound, but comes across more muddy and muffled than I'd like, even with the available sound enhancement settings and features. To me, It just doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose system that I had in the CX- 9, or those found in the Premium 3 / CX-30's I test drove (if you‚Äôre a bit of an audiophile, you might consider one of these aforementioned models). The 5 is a great CUV, and could be even better if it had the same Bose setup found in the 3 / CX-30. That would make it a home run. Maybe Mazda will up the sound game for the 5's next generation model. I'm hoping so."
CX-5,Cars,"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily found with the hand without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn‚Äôt as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff ‚Äì which we don‚Äôt.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content ‚Äì if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.  
We are very happy with our new CX-5."
CX-5,Cars,"Having owned several Mazda's, it's easy to perform multiple tasks without having to take your eyes off the road. Everything from making calls, picking favorites on the radio, just to mention a couple."
CX-5,Cars,"This compact SUV so far is great, I have had it for 4 weeks. Seats are firm and well built, a tad snug. Nice firm ride and great handling. I have the Signature AWD and turbo engine. Not the best MPG but very good performance for its class. Storage is a little small but as much as I need. Great cameras and safety features, probably close to as good as it gets short of some advanced features and near self driving. Steering wheel warms up in just seconds though just on the sides. The heated seats are better than my old Cadillac and warm fairly quickly, warm air comes out within a mile of driving (10 second warm up) then the new remote start is nice when it has been out in the cold for several hours. For a compact SUV it has the the lineage of my Miata. Adaptive headlights are wonderful. New update infotainment system works well. Overall I chose it over a BMW, almost a rival but still the best bang for the bucks. Crystal Lake Mazda has been great to work with."
CX-5,Cars,Love the car and exterior color we chose is very classy and unique.  We bought the car because it is rated the #1 SUV for its reliability and affordable pricing.
CX-5,Cars,"If you are looking for a fun car to drive, look no further. This car is head and shoulders above its class. Fit and finish is premium. I cross shopped it with Acura RDX. Even though Acura was more fun to drive, Mazda gives much more for the money. I could not justify $10K extra for Acura. You can get good gas mileage if you drive it with light foot."
CX-5,Cars,"For the money, you can not find another car in the price range that is comparable  in terms of luxury and driving experience. I'm actually surprised you don't see more of them on the road."
CX-5,Cars,The car is very comfortable.  It's got a lot of wonderful features that I still have to learn how to use (just bought it).  Did a lot of research prior to looking.  It was rated very highly and wasn't overpriced.
CX-5,Cars,"The Mazda CX-5 has everything I waned and more! Clean lines, great performance, excellent driving in all types of roads. The best car I have ever owned!"
CX-5,Cars,The comfort of the seats is my favorite part which helps for long car rides! Love the heated seats and sunroof! My only wish is that the sunroof extended farther back and was electric. The control system is easy to use and the Bose speakers are amazing. This car gets great gas mileage and is so easy and fun to drive. Has lots of room in the back for storage and it helps the back seats come down. I love this Mazda and all the features! Highly reccommend!
CX-5,Cars,"I bought this car for my 16 year old because of all the safety features it offered. The car is beautifully designed, and drives like a cloud. The Mazda Care package offered through Hendrick Mazda was a great way to get some extras for a great price!"
CX-5,Cars,"I purchased the Carbon Turbo CX5, and I adore my new car. It had everything I requested- heater seats, tinted windows, remote start, and sun roof. It is a beautiful color, and has red leather seats (swoon). I am very very happy with my decision."
CX-5,Cars,The vehicle is just a safe overall vehicle with a great ride. Love the features and the design of the vehicle. Mazda did a great job on producing the cx5
CX-5,Cars,"I had a 2019 CX5 and have been very happy with it's comfort and overall performance. I read many articles about the improvements in the 2021 models. This years' model is so quiet inside and the new Bose stereo system is amazing to me. The engine has more zip and is noticeably smoother. That was hard to believe, as I was very impressed with the 2019 model."
CX-5,Cars,"The only thing I don't like is no interior  lighting  with exception  to the norm . It dark at night . I'm use to some floor or side lights inside at night, Also never had to purchase  a card for navigation"
Forester,Cars,"This car is abysmal and Subaru LIED about the mpg. It's absolutely absurd. In mixed driving - cold weather, warm weather, whatever - is 20mpg. On the hwy it gets 21.5. It's disgusting. And it has ZERO pickup. It sounds like it's dying when I try to get up to speed on the hwy - much less up a hill. My previous car was an Alltrack. They claimed I woudl get 31/22. I got 33/28.5. Sure, it wasn't as good in the snow, but at least I could drive more than a week before filling up again. And I never feared for my life when trying to accelerate accross a street! So awful. But the seats are cushy!"
Forester,Cars,"I have only been leasing this car for a few weeks but I am in love! The handling, safety features, styling, and technology are all on point."
Forester,Cars,Did not answer Reliability as I just got it but the reviews are good.  So far I really - really like it!  The more i drive it the more it seems to fit me better.  Not a fan of a CVT but this has pep without using the sport drive.  Lots of nice soft surfaces in this vehicle which is really nice.  Great stereo system.  Handles really great!  Gas mileage is really good for AWD.
Forester,Cars,"We looked at Lexus, BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes SUV‚Äôs. This Forrester Touring has similar comfort but greater practicality and visibility.
The other luxury cars are clearly more comfortable and refined but not for $25K-$40K more.
We are in our mid 70‚Äôs and wanted safety and confidence in adverse weather situations. We believe this was a more intelligent choice. It also is attractive and rides quietly and nice."
Forester,Cars,Great car. Reliable. This is the third Forester and fourth Subaru we own. Won‚Äôt hesitate to continue with this make of vehicle. Staff was excellent to work with and very attentive to our needs.
Forester,Cars,"This is my 3rd Subaru Forester, I just love this make and model. It is a very comfortable car and very quiet. I have the Limited version, it has all the amenities I could ask for. My 1st Subaru I bought used, I hit a deer with it, killed the deer and no damage at all to the car or me, at that point I was sold on the superior quality of Subaru's.  On the highway I average 30-32 mpg."
Forester,Cars,"This is our 2nd Forester.  It has amazing safety features as well as ease of entry.  The doors open very wide.

We are also thrilled with the sales staff at Peoria Subaru in Peoria AZ."
Forester,Cars,This car feels very safe and seems to perform well.  I really like the great visibility.  It's the best I've tried. The car handles well in snow where others dont.
Forester,Cars,I always on American cars then I found a good deal on a used Subaru legacy then I was hooked between the fun driving these automobiles in the service behind them I recommend you give them a try
Forester,Cars,This SUV meets all our needs and gives features that we didn't even expect Being older drivers the safety and driver assist allow us to feel very safe behind the wheel.
Forester,Cars,"This car is going to be around for a while! We got it because of the all wheel drive, but it has so much more to offer: heated seats, x-mode, apple/android auto. I can auto start my car from my phone, I have the convenience of the truck with a smooth ride. I used to live Honda because of the buttery drive, my Subi drives super smooth too. Subi knows their value and I think they care about the customer and their safety first, everything else falls in place because of that."
Forester,Cars,"The Subaru Forester (Touring Model) is a very sharp looking vehicle. The interior has a lot of space and the sound system is awesome. It also has many safety precautions. I have only owned it for a few months, but so far, I love it!"
Forester,Cars,Car is comfortable with good space. It is quiet with a smooth ride. Sound system is fantastic. Looking forward to trips in our new car.
Forester,Cars,"This Forester has great style, tons of cargo room and handles like a dream on all types of terrain!  So glad I made this purchase."
Forester,Cars,This is my second Subaru Forester I like the Foresters driving performance.  Great in winter weather with snowy roads. Very smooth ride.  I would consider another one for my next car.
Forester,Cars,I love all of the extras on my new car! Safety was my priority. Great safety features and love the look. It‚Äôs an SUV that feels more like a car. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm driving a truck.
Forester,Cars,"Had never seriously considered a Subaru. After some research, had decided on purchasing a used VW Alltrack. Checked dealer Web site again the morning i planned to purchase the VW and on a whim, browsed Subaru. 1st pic that came up was interior of a 2021 white Forester Sport. Perhaps because I was coming from a VW Passat known for its very conservative styling, I was instantly smitten w the Forester interior. After doing some more research I decided on the Forester. I bought it used w about 2.4K mikes on it. It served as a demo car. I feel the $27k price was quite fair. 

Visibility is amazing. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and there is still plenty of headroom left. The tall side glass and clever side mirror placement and extra triangle glass makes seeing out a breeze. Even rearward visibility is great. The extra large sunroof makes for an even airier environment. I will say the front seat bottom is just long enough. Any shorter and for me it would be an uncomfortable ride. If your inseam is longer than 36‚Äù the seats might be uncomfortable for you. While the back seat bottoms are just long enough for most, and the area is very roomy my legs couldn‚Äôt endure a king ride back there. But again I‚Äôm quite tall so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem For most. Those who have rode in the back find it very comfortable and enjoy that the seating height is higher than in front giving them a great view ahead. Cargo room is what i really love.  W the seats down, I can fit my 2x bike in there without removing the wheels. That‚Äôs a big deal for me.  

I find the power more than sufficient for the vehicle type and my mainly commuting purposes. I find the acceleration very responsive when I apply smooth steady pressure to the gas pedal. Punching the pedal, for me, resulted in a brash take off that seemed slower overall than when I apply a steady foot. I just took my first road trip, 600 miles, and now it seems the vehicle is broken in and the responsiveness is even better. Currently have about 4.2k mikes on it. 

This Sport came w the upgrade package that incl Harmon sound, auto back up monitor and braking and power lift gate. The suite of safety features is complete - lane departure, auto braking to emergency stop, adaptive cruise. The cruise works very well and accelerates very well when the car slows down for slower traffic and then finds sufficient open space to increase speed. Over the month I‚Äôve had it I‚Äôve learned how to manage the safety features and drive in such a way that it‚Äôs not annoying at all. Doing simple things like always signaling when changing lanes prevents the steering wheel from bucking back against your steering inputs. The torque vectoring allows for snappy handling when switching lanes and the turning radius is very tight and makes for great parking lot maneuvering.

I love driving this CUV. I recent sat in a family members Rogue and then another‚Äôs CRV. I left both thinking I‚Äôm so glad I got the Subaru. When I see VW Alltracks drive by, I thank my lucky stars I did not get it. I highly recommend this vehicle."
Forester,Cars,"Besides the outside appearance, is the safety of the vehicle. All the safety features, gas savings, roomy and all the benefits that you can, i.e. service, maintenance and so on."
Forester,Cars,Very few problems and very dependable. The 2015 was trade in for the new 2021 Forester which I believe will be even a better car.
Forester,Cars,Just purchased the vehicle yesterday.  After test drive liked the ride and will update after driving it for a few months.  At this point I would recommend the Forester to others seeking to purchase a new car.
Forester,Cars,"This car meets all my needs and has the best safety rating! Suburu is a car that I trust and feel safe in!!
Glad to be part of the Subaru family!"
Forester,Cars,"I just purchased my 2021 Subaru Forester Limited which has a lot of options. aI only have 101 miles on it. I'm am 4'9"" and I can see over the steering wheel without being on top of the wheel.  The features seam awesome, and I love the power liftgate. It rides excellent.  I am very happy with this car so far."
Forester,Cars,"We have owned for only a few days, but the car has all of the features we need, great room front and back and great comfort."
Forester,Cars,"I couldn't be happier with my 2021 Subaru Forester.  I purchased the Limited trim package and just love it!  I thought my previous car, a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe had lots of bells and whistles, but my new Forester seems even more luxurious.  It's a much smoother ride.  The road I live on is dirt and has lots of ruts, but I don't bounce around as much as in my old vehicle.  The only thing I don't like is how loud the seat belt reminder is.  It starts chiming as soon as I start the engine and quickly becomes progressively louder and louder and louder, which I find very annoying."
Forester,Cars,The car is perfect size for my wife and I. We like all the safety features and the car feels solid when you‚Äôre driving it. The ride is great and it handles very well. All the features are easily accessible the car is easy to use.
Forester,Cars,"We purchased the Touring model as it included all the safety features as standard.  In addition, this car gets better gas mileage on the highway than my previous Subaru.  Would I purchase another Subaru?  Yes, as this is the 6th Subaru we have owned.  Great car."
Forester,Cars,"Best Subaru we‚Äôve owned. It compares most favorably to our best car ever - our Volvo 850 from long ago!  Love the handling, seating comfort, sound system - great car!"
Forester,Cars,"This car meets my needs of comfort seating, leg room,
Traveling space and room for grandkids!!with all the new gadgets I need to learn I‚Äôm sure we will be extra safe."
Forester,Cars,"This is my first time owning a Subaru and I am very impressed with everything they have to offer. I feel super safe, comfortable, and current with all the available new tech. I like the way they monitor the car constantly and really treated me great during my buying experience. And, this SUV is great on gas too."
Forester,Cars,The perfect size for me. It handles well  and the controls are easy to operate. Great gas mileage. Super comfortable. Reasonably priced and looks beautiful!
Forester,Cars,I really like this car and feel really safe in it! I highly recommend it if you have children too!  The sensors are excellent and the lane safety features are great for someone like me who does a lot of commuting!
Forester,Cars,Has a wonderful look and drives wonderfully. I also love all the safety features.  This is my second forester.  Had a cross trek in between but do like forester better.  Easier to get in and out of and more cargo space
Forester,Cars,Perfect car for me at this point of my life.  Maybe i should not have waited so long.....  It will help my navigate snowy winters and small grandchildren.
Forester,Cars,"This car is great!  Roomy, controls are easily accessible, the visibility is great, it handles well and is easy to park.  I test drove some of the competitors and found this the best.  Also my insurance rates are lower with this model versus the competitors."
Forester,Cars,I love my Forester Sport so far. I do not even have 1000 miles on it and I am averaging 31 MPG in mixed driving. Very comfortable car as well!
Forester,Cars,"Love my new Forester, unbelievable all the extras the base model has!  Comfortable drives very nice, learning more about it daily!  Thank you Colleen at Horne Auto in Show low az!! You made this happen!! She is great!"
Forester,Cars,"This is my 6th! Subaru.  I happen to lease every 3 years.
They have updated 2021 Forester.  Larger and more styled
which I appreciate while keeping safety at its core."
Forester,Cars,"I always wanted to have a Subaru. I didn‚Äôt know if I would have it as my first buy car. But I‚Äôm so glad I went with it, and the forester itself has so much space and is very comfortable for me and when I have passengers."
Forester,Cars,This vehicle has all of my needs which care safety first. Than reliability. Value for your money. And well designed interior.  I fell in love with the two tone seats. It drives like a dream.
Forester,Cars,"Ladies preference for a vehicle which has all of the required features to assist with safety. Cameras are nicely positioned and the lane control, automatic braking and subsequent acceleration when the the cruise control is on is very helpful. Hopefully this SUV will last a long time."
Forester,Cars,"Will advise upon further driving ,found that the extra elements for upgrade are a little pricey right now but are of specifications from the Manufacturer ."
Forester,Cars,"I've been driving a Chevy Silverado for two years and decided we needed something more efficient on fuel.  After test driving several vehicles,  comparing fuel and safety features it was a no brainer to go with this new Forester."
Forester,Cars,Love the features!!! Easy to handle!!! Happy thus far!!! Smooth ride/ comfortable seats / spacious/ awesome privacy blind / amble rear seat space/ beautiful rims !!!
Forester,Cars,"Former Honda owner (for 21 years) and made a change after seeing a decline in the overall Honda product.  I have owned my Forester for one month, have over 2,100 miles on it now and love everything about it, with one exception, the seat belt (that is the reason for 4 stars on comfort).  I wish the latch was longer - it has taken some getting used too - but that is my only complaint.  Ride is great, handling unbelievable and solid and don't pay any attention to the complaints about power and acceleration - it gets you where you need to go without any problems.  I look for reasons to drive the car.  My only regret is that I did not make the change sooner."
Forester,Cars,This is my third Forester.  It is a reliable car that fits my needs perfectly.  I love the new headlights that see around a corner and the seat comfort.  The cargo space is bigger than most cars in this class.  It just drives well on short and long trips.
Forester,Cars,It has everything I wanted in a car.  Absolutely love this car.  This is my second Subaru Forester.  He handles well on the road and is great on gas.
Forester,Cars,"Considering my old car didn‚Äôt even have Bluetooth, I‚Äôm in heaven. No blind spots, it has intermittent wipers! So much more than I‚Äôve ever had. Excellent car!"
Forester,Cars,Very happy with our new Subaru Forrester 2021. It is meeting all of our needs and is a pleasure to drive! Feel very safe as well!
Forester,Cars,This car rides smoother and has plenty of leg and head room. The Cabin is quiet compared to other vehicles we have owned.  Very pleased.
Forester,Cars,"Only weeks old but seems to be an excellent vehicle. Enormous number of new technical/operational controls. As I become familiar with them, I find them to be extremely helpful."
Forester,Cars,This is my second Forester. I was a long time Toyota owner but now that I have switched to Subaru I don't think I'll  ever go back.  The Forester has superior AWD making it easy to handle  and the boxy shape increases the driver's viewing capability. I hope this never changes!
Forester,Cars,"Safest, better resale, reliable, very best Eye Sight  feels like driving down a velvet tunnel. All wheel drive makes handling great even if you don‚Äôt go off road. They keep making important safety and design upgrades. I have driven rentals, family and friends cars over the years and Subaru is the best all around and at an affordable price."
Forester,Cars,"Always loved the Forester so I finally got one and I'm thrilled! It's a great car; roomy, great visibility, high level of safety and great standard features on the Limited edition. I would highly recommend this car."
Forester,Cars,This is our 4th Subaru and our favorite so far. We chose the Sport model of the Forester. We love the technology and all of the new safety features plus it's very comfortable getting in and out.
Forester,Cars,this car meet all my needs  Plenty headroom good visability very comfortable to drive. Plenty room for my grandsons and my grocery's   alot of room in backseat even for adults.
Forester,Cars,My wife is short and loves that the Forester sits high and with all the windows allows for good visibility. also is great in the snow.
Forester,Cars,This SUV meets our needs for comfort and also having AWD to get around in bad weather. Bought it to replace a 2001 Subaru that still has a lot of life left in it. These are great cars.
Forester,Cars,This is a perfect car for me.....roomy.......comfortable.....safe.....reliable....and great looking!  It is perfect for every day use and great for trips to see the grandchildren or just exploring.
Forester,Cars,This is my third Forester. They are comfortable and handle well; great for long trips or driving around town.  Lots of bells and whistles on this model. Techies will love it.
Forester,Cars,"I've only had it for over a week, but I am enjoying the heated steering wheel and the comfort PLUS the AWD. I'm impressed with the leg and head room as well."
Forester,Cars,Just bought the car today and I already know  I will have it for a long time! I love the ease of driving and the safety features
Forester,Cars,"Very reliable and comfortable car.
Interior style was most appealing.
Safety features were better than expected and we are confident driving this automobile.
Plan to purchase other Subaru's in the future."
Forester,Cars,This car has wonderful safety features and handles well in different weather conditions.  It's higher clearance is a plus in snowy mountain conditions.  I have owned a Subaru for 10 year and this one is even better than my last one.
Forester,Cars,"The 2021 forester is an amazing upgrade from the 2018 iI had, and I loved that one. The technology and safety features make it so much better"
Forester,Cars,"This is the third Subaru Forester that we have owned and we like this one most of all.  We like the comfort and styling, but most of all we like the safety features."
Forester,Cars,"Second Forester that I have owned. This is a great vehicle! Reliable, smooth ride, great gas mileage, nice looking, it is the complete package! Would recommend it highly!"
Forester,Cars,"Plenty of legroom, very comfortable for tall drivers and passengers. Lots of cargo room. Beautiful interior and paint. Lots of room. Definitely recommend this car!"
Forester,Cars,"We looked at many different types of cars and chose the Subaru Forester Touring for its reputation, reliability, durability, safety, comfort, value, options etc combined with the teamwork at Burke Motor Group in Cape May NJ! Our salesman was, JAMES HANNAN, who went above and beyond for us! From DOUGLAS BURKE; JAMES HANNAN, Sales Professional; JEREMY, GM; CHRIS, Finance; CONNOR, Service etc every question we had was answered and quickly! James and the Burke Team were wonderfully supportive and explained every detail thoroughly and the process was smooth and easy! We couldn't be happier with our 2021 Forester Touring and would HIGHLY recommend ""Subaru"" and ""The Burke Motor Group"" without reservation! 5 Stars ‚≠ê"
Forester,Cars,"So far this SUV has all the interior accessories and accommodations needed. Love the headlights especially at night. This vehicle will center approximately and warn (blind sight area ) of on coming vehicles . Navigation/temperature control and so much more. So far, we love this vehicle."
Forester,Cars,This vehicle has exceeded all our expectations.  The interior is spacious and lots of room for people and cargo. The new Subaru platform creates a very comfortable and firm driving experience. MPG is great and the Sport trim level definitely draws attention. The safety features of the eyesight system have worked flawlessly so far and make driving much so much more enjoyable!
Forester,Cars,This car meets all of my needs with plenty of legroom and fine interior setting. Being AWD it really holds on to the road and makes driving a pleasure.The exterior design is beautiful and looks strong.
Forester,Cars,It‚Äôs a great car...the features are wonderful...I don‚Äôt want to drive anything but a Forester! It makes me feel safe and it‚Äôs very enjoyable to ride in.
Forester,Cars,I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Forester but the design and overall comfort was not to my liking. It feels like you are driving in a box which may be okay for some folks since the interior visibility in excellent because of the car shape. Otherwise the fit and finish of the car was above average and it seemed very steady on the highway. Road noise seemed pronounced to me in around town driving. Not for me but maybe a worthwhile car for some.
Forester,Cars,Purchased My third Subaru.  It is my comfort zone in vehicles. Very Reliable with good gas mileage.  Feel safe and especially like all the  safety features added.
Forester,Cars,"Comparing with my previous RAV4 (4 Toyotas since 1990) , I am surprised by my first Subaru which I just bought one month ago, 4x wheels in Base model, quiet (was noisy in RAV4), smart headlight system, smart cruise control....  etc. Of course, price is good :-)   It's much worth.   I am leaving Toyota"
Forester,Cars,"This car is comfortable ,has the safety features I need and drives like a luxury vehicle. My only complaint  is  that it does not provide a place for a woman's handbag. The seats can be adjusted to accommodate both my husband and me due to our large height difference."
Forester,Cars,This car has everything I needed.  It is AWD on all styles.  The Forester is extremely comfortable and spacious inside.  O‚ÄôLeary of headroom and leg room.  The trunk space is also roomy for an SUV.  Great vehicle!!
Forester,Cars,"One smooth ride. Quiet. Great vision. Latest electronics, USB ports, etc. Lots of room. Looks great. The whole family enjoyed the ride and yours will too."
Forester,Cars,"This car has everything I was looking for when purchasing a new car. Thank you, Nicole, I am so glad that I purchased this car!"
Forester,Cars,"Upgrades are very reasonable and the safety features are amazing.  I will own this vehicle for a long time.   Did I mention comfort,  The best!"
Forester,Cars,Great fit and finish. Comfortable and spacious overall ride. Top safety rating according to NHTSA.  Completely satisfied. Consumer Reports rated the Forester top small SUV.
Forester,Cars,"This car met all my needs for safety. I am a nurse I work 60 hours a week, I finally feel safe driving home at night from work when I m tired."
Forester,Cars,So far it has met all my expectations.  Perfect size and very comfortable for my wife and myself.  Vehicle's performance has been great. My first experience with a Subaru auto.
Forester,Cars,"This car is exactly what we need for mountain and city driving and for long road trips. It performs well in snow and has incredible safety features (great for us older drivers). Wonderful sound system, beautiful ride!"
Forester,Cars,"I have been driving Subaru Foresters for both work and personal use since 1999.  These cars / SUVs are very reliable, and provide extra confidence and safety in challenging weather and road conditions."
Forester,Cars,"Perfect for our needs  with great visibility,  doors open wide allowing for easy entry and exit, very comfortable seats, and has top safety ratings for an SUV."
Forester,Cars,"The 2021 Forester easily meets our needs and is exceeding expectations.  We were looking for a smaller SUV, but with plenty of leg room and decent storage.  This car clearly delivers! Also, the safety features and upgraded features that are part of the Touring trim have been a nice add."
Forester,Cars,I love the forester. The car handles like a dream Fantastic in snow. So many safety features.  This is the first time I bought the same car twice.  All-American Subaru great dealership great personnel
Forester,Cars,"Versatile, safe, good driving, comfortable, great quality and  workmanship. Great car at a fair price.  We liked our first Forester so much we had to trade for another."
Forester,Cars,"I love the design-the reliability and gas mileage is awesome!!!
My sunroof is the bomb! The visibility and safety features are reassuring.
We own several Subaru‚Äôs."
Forester,Cars,"Just what we were looking for, both beautiful and safe. Love all the extra comfort features, plus the ones we expected, the safest car on the road."
Forester,Cars,"The car is well engineered and well thought out.   Too many wonderful features to describe here.  I would recommend test driving one, and seriously considering purchasing it."
Forester,Cars,"This 'non-luxury' car is way easier to drive than the luxury cars I test drove.  The car stops itself going forward and reverse, stays in its lane at speeds above 30 on cruise control, and matches the speed of the car infront of you.  I have never heard better stock sound coming out a new vehicle before; it blows HD Radio out of the water.  The ONLY negative is that you need to have the radio on or sun roof open because the engine is loud when accelerating."
Forester,Cars,The Forester Limited with all options is a great car from bumper to bumper.  No wonder it is the best selling model in the Subaru lineup.
Forester,Cars,This car meets all my needs. I used to own a low car and I recently bought a SUV. At first I was very intimidated to drive a SUV but this car is absolutely amazing. The settings of this car is incredible. It's not to big but not to small. The car is very spacious.
Forester,Cars,This is my second Forester.  Very roomy and great gas mileage!  Handles very well in rain and snow.  Would recommend to anyone looking for great gas mileage and a very comfortable ride.
Forester,Cars,"I fell in love with this car on the test drive. The ride is so smooth, the interior is comfortable and stylish. I love the safety features and the giant moon roof."
Forester,Cars,"Safety,  reliability, price, comfortable to drive. I am and will always be a Subaru owner. This vehicle is also pet friendly,  just made for us"
Forester,Cars,The 2021 Forrester Sport is a big improvement from the previous Forrester I drove. Like the new electronic offerings on this vehicle. Would definitely recommend this vehicle to others.
Forester,Cars,"The car is great for space, safe, great features, good on gas. It met all the needs I will use it for, skiing, traveling, back roads"
Forester,Cars,"Had the lane assist feature, check the back seat feature and steel rods in the back door panels which makes it possible  for a passenger to open the door even if door was smashed due to an accident."
Forester,Cars,"This car meets all my needs and from past experience I know how reliable and safe Subaru‚Äôs are.  Years ago my daughter was involved in a roll-over accident and were it not for the fact that she was in our Subaru, well she not be here today."
Forester,Cars,"My 2014 Forester met all my needs and I am certain my new Forester will do the same. Always reliable, comfortable and easy to drive."
Forester,Cars,Great ride and awesome visibility while driving.  The ride is so smooth and quiet compared to similar vehicles in this class.  It came down to the Honda CRV and the Forester and we feel we made the right choice!
Forester,Cars,"This car meets all my needs,. It is a safe and reliable car with great interior and exterior features and I am enjoying the smooth ride!"
Forester,Cars,"Just bought the 2021 Subaru Forester and picked it up last week. The salesman Nick was great to work with and when he wasn't available Nazar Martyniouk was right there to step in and help us to finalize the deal. The car came in earlier than expected and that made it even better.
    We went to pick it up and Nick explained how to work all the new gadgets in the car. Safety being number one, then fuel economy and lastly informational items were all explained very professionally. 
   Thank you Muller Subaru."
Forester,Cars,"This car meets our needs, The seats are comfortable. The ride is smooth and stable, The visibiiity is excellent and the safety features are reassuring"
RAV4,Cars,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I‚Äôve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I‚Äôll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
RAV4,Cars,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
RAV4,Cars,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it‚Äôs fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
RAV4,Cars,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
RAV4,Cars,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
RAV4,Cars,I feel safe and very comfortable in my ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can‚Äôt wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
RAV4,Cars,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
RAV4,Cars,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
RAV4,Cars,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
RAV4,Cars,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
Rogue,KBB,"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn‚Äôt even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven‚Äôt seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, ‚ÄúSUVs are just not that exciting.‚Äù I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It‚Äôs comfortable, but it‚Äôs also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn‚Äôt have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I‚Äôve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I‚Äôm excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn‚Äôt feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one. 

I firmly believe this vehicle belongs higher up on the lists."
Rogue,KBB,"Leased the car on 11/23/2020 when my lease on the 2018 was about to mature.   Starting two weeks later trouble with the display  , then the remote starter.  Warning lights come and alerts flash on and off for no reason.   When I went to enter the car after shopping the emergency brake engaged kept flashing.  And would not  disengage.   Yesterday while driving the alert beep went off and a warning lights flashes on the dashboard.   As quick as it went on it went off    Everyone it goes in for service  the say there is no code for them to figure out what is going .    Car is a safety risk.   My other Rogues were great and no problem this one is a big disappointment  and very frustrating"

Rogue,KBB,"Good gas mileage in ECO, infotainment, A/C, Safety"
Rogue,KBB,Premium package not included so no heated seats
Rogue,KBB,"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Its a bit early to rate reliability and value."
Rogue,KBB,"More power , comfort"
Rogue,KBB,Safety features like Steering assist only work wi
Rogue,KBB,"Car is very nice overall,  fuel  consumption still high I never reached 28 mpg in the town, but the car very powerful."
Rogue,KBB,"Premium interiors, near hybrid level fuel economy"
Rogue,KBB,Not class leading horsepower numbers
Rogue,KBB,Had few months and few options to decide on a car before I went with Rogue. Platinum model has all the bells and whistles you would want in a crossover. It has the best interiors and quietist interior cabin compared with CRV and Rav4. Seats are great and amazing for long distance drives. Ride quality is fine for this class and has the best Gauge cluster screen.
Rogue,KBB,Trade in my Nissan Rogue 2019 for 2021 Nissan Rogue on January 10 had for three weeks and my car will not start up had been at Dealership since February 5 2022 have Engine problems I recommend not to buy this car
Rogue,KBB,"Quiet, nice interior"
Rogue,KBB,"Reliability, quality, too many issues"
Rogue,KBB,"In the eight  months we owned this car we drove it only four of the eight
Months. The vehicle was in the shop constantly starting with bilateral roof leaks, infotainment system turning on and off, car panels shifting to the point we couldn‚Äôt open the doors, AC issues and CVT issues. Avoid this car like the plaque. Thankfully it was sold back under the lemon law."
Rogue,KBB,"Enjoyable to drive, comfortable, great tech"
Rogue,KBB,None
Rogue,KBB,"I love everything about my Rogue. It‚Äôs comfortable, looks great inside and out, handles great, and I haven‚Äôt had any issues so far. It‚Äôs a big improvement from the previous generation.  Interior quality is a lot better than the competitors I checked out and took for a test drive. Very satisfied."

Passenger seat belt hard yo buckle.

Rogue,KBB,"Got this car in November of 2020, and I still look forward to driving it everyday! I've ceramic coated it with Adams Graphene and is always shiny! I keep it clean at all times and don't treat it like a garbage can. I'm considering getting a 2022 to have a turbo version. I'm getting a combined 30 mpg. LOVE IT!!"

Rogue,KBB,"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver‚Äôs side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver‚Äôs side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the ‚Äúinfotainment system‚Äù has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an ‚Äúoff‚Äù type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70‚Äôs where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe."
Rogue,KBB,"Favorites:
1. Zero gravity seats.  No more aching behind or restricted blood flow on longer rides.  I wish my apt was full of these.
2. Panoramic sunroof.  Lots of light.  it's huge.
3. Interior.  so sophisticated from the mini shifter embedded in scratched woodish materials.  The leather wrapped steering wheqQd"
Rogue,KBB,Love the look & red color ( which costs more).
Rogue,KBB,"Touch screen, too complicated , shifter bad design"
Rogue,KBB,"I purchased this car 4 months ago and have had No Mechanical Problems. What I don‚Äôt like is that there are way too many bell‚Äôs & whistles. It has taken me several months to turn off the warning buzzers & alerts. I really dislike not being able to shift into park when you stop‚Ä¶everything is all electronic. The touch screen info system is often unresponsive which makes a change difficult when driving. There is a LOT of wind/ road noise T 60mph. At 1,000 rpm the steering wheel vibrates. The dealer said it is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Just not satisfied for $31,000."
Rogue,KBB,Great safety features and style
Rogue,KBB,Suspension and quality control.
Rogue,KBB,"traded my 2018 Rouge in for the new 2021. BIG Mistake!  Worst suspension in a vehicle I have ever owned. One little bump and this things goes into a tizzy. A/C wont adjust, air vent on passenger side not working. I like the look of the new Rouge and it does have nice features but my 2018 rouge had more features than this and the ride was 90% better. It's a lease and the bright side is I can't dump this thing back on the dealers lot in three years. Time for a brand change I think."
Rogue,KBB,Nicely equipped for the price
Rogue,KBB,none yet
Rogue,KBB,"I purchased the SV model with a sticker price of $29,500. The interior is very attractive.  While this model does not have all the 'bells & whistles' of the more expensive SUVs, it is nicely equipped.  Great safety features.  The ride is smooth for a mid priced SUV and comfortable to drive.  If you looking for an affordable SUV, this one is for you.  Only have driven the SUV for a few weeks so no issues yet.  Friends of mine are on their 2nd Rogue and they loved both."
Rogue,KBB,Good mix
Rogue,KBB,Not much

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Its a bit early to rate reliability and value."

Rogue,KBB,"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver‚Äôs side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver‚Äôs side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the ‚Äúinfotainment system‚Äù has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an ‚Äúoff‚Äù type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70‚Äôs where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe."
Rogue,KBB,"Favorites:
1. Zero gravity seats.  No more aching behind or restricted blood flow on longer rides.  I wish my apt was full of these.

Rogue,KBB,"I purchased this car 4 months ago and have had No Mechanical Problems. What I don‚Äôt like is that there are way too many bell‚Äôs & whistles. It has taken me several months to turn off the warning buzzers & alerts. I really dislike not being able to shift into park when you stop‚Ä¶everything is all electronic. The touch screen info system is often unresponsive which makes a change difficult when driving. There is a LOT of wind/ road noise T 60mph. At 1,000 rpm the steering wheel vibrates.

Rogue,KBB,"traded my 2018 Rouge in for the new 2021. BIG Mistake!  Worst suspension in a vehicle I have ever owned. One little bump and this things goes into a tizzy. A/C wont adjust, air vent on passenger side not working. I like the look of the new Rouge and it does have nice features but my 2018 rouge had more features than this and the ride was 90% better.

The ride is smooth for a mid priced SUV and comfortable to drive.  If you looking for an affordable SUV, this one is for you.  Only have driven the SUV for a few weeks so no issues yet.  Friends of mine are on their 2nd Rogue and they loved both."

Rogue,KBB,"No complaints, does what it should and hasn't complained. Nice touch screen and speakers standard, check it out"
Rogue,KBB,"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn‚Äôt even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven‚Äôt seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, ‚ÄúSUVs are just not that exciting.‚Äù I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It‚Äôs comfortable, but it‚Äôs also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn‚Äôt have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I‚Äôve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I‚Äôm excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn‚Äôt feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one. 

I firmly believe this vehicle belongs higher up on the lists."
Rogue,KBB,"Leased the car on 11/23/2020 when my lease on the 2018 was about to mature.   Starting two weeks later trouble with the display  , then the remote starter.  Warning lights come and alerts flash on and off for no reason.   When I went to enter the car after shopping the emergency brake engaged kept flashing.  And would not  disengage.   Yesterday while driving the alert beep went off and a warning lights flashes on the dashboard.   As quick as it went on it went off    Everyone it goes in for service  the say there is no code for them to figure out what is going .    Car is a safety risk.   My other Rogues were great and no problem this one is a big disappointment  and very frustrating"

Equinox,KBB,"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere. The drive handles amazing whether you're having to do sharp turns, keep on your lane at 80 miles, or going on an off-road trail. Overall I give my chevy equinox a 10/10."

Equinox,KBB,"This is my third Equinox, and is probably the best!  It's a Premier, so it has many extra features.
Although I miss my CD player, with Sirrius and Pandora, I can receive beautiful music through a fine audio system.  Prior to purchasing, I drove numerous small to medium size SUVs, however, most
did not feel as solid as the Equinox.  Several were smaller and lighter, however with the number of miles I drive, I wanted the feeling of a comfortable and substantial vehicle, which could travel on ice and snow, get reasonably good gas mileage.  Those which were similar in ride and comfort were far more expensive."
Equinox,KBB,Styling.
Equinox,KBB,Quality and lack of support from GM on issues.
Equinox,KBB,"Purchased with 5 miles on the car. Since the beginning I've  had 3 issues, electrical glitch with blindside warning coming on and not able to adjust the radio with the steering wheel controls.
The AWD warning for system issues. Finally the vehicle in the dealership for a month having the the axels replaced at 3K miles. GM doesn't care about the quality of their vehicles  or the inconvenience to their customers. I have bought 4 new GM products in 5 years and never will again."
Equinox,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."

Equinox,KBB,"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere. The drive handles amazing whether you're having to do sharp turns, keep on your lane at 80 miles, or going on an off-road trail. Overall I give my chevy equinox a 10/10."

did not feel as solid as the Equinox.

The AWD warning for system issues. Finally the vehicle in the dealership for a month having the the axels replaced at 3K miles. GM doesn't care about the quality of their vehicles  or the inconvenience to their customers. I have bought 4 new GM products in 5 years and never will again."
Equinox,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."

Equinox,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."
Equinox,KBB,"I have the Equinox 1LT, sticker price 29,745 (approx).
  I am extremely happy with the driving of this vehicle, much better than expert reviews detail. MPG for my 1.5 front wheel drive is 31.7 over approx 3200 miles. Very satisfied with this. Plenty of power for me, I am not a speed demon and want good MPG vs Power. Excellent set up with the 2018 Equinox w/ 1.5 liter.
  Interior is very nice, drives great. I-phone connection works great. Could be a better GPS set up.

Equinox,KBB,"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere.

Escape,KBB,"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere. The drive handles amazing whether you're having to do sharp turns, keep on your lane at 80 miles, or going on an off-road trail. Overall I give my chevy equinox a 10/10."

The AWD warning for system issues. Finally the vehicle in the dealership for a month having the the axels replaced at 3K miles. GM doesn't care about the quality of their vehicles  or the inconvenience to their customers. I have bought 4 new GM products in 5 years and never will again."
Escape,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."
Escape,KBB,"I have the Equinox 1LT, sticker price 29,745 (approx).

Plenty of power for me, I am not a speed demon and want good MPG vs Power. Excellent set up with the 2018 Equinox w/ 1.5 liter.

Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."
Escape,KBB,"I have the Equinox 1LT, sticker price 29,745 (approx).
  I am extremely happy with the driving of this vehicle, much better than expert reviews detail. MPG for my 1.5 front wheel drive is 31.7 over approx 3200 miles. Very satisfied with this. Plenty of power for me, I am not a speed demon and want good MPG vs Power. Excellent set up with the 2018 Equinox w/ 1.5 liter.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"I had a 18 honda crv and felt bored and everyone has one. This suv was definitely not the crown honda raves about.
Seen a bad lands 6 weeks ago and became obsessed. After looking I realized you cannot get one easy. 4 weeks, 118 miles and buying sight unseen or have driven one I bought it over the phone. This is not me or my personality. I crewed off every finger nail till I got to the dealership. I seen my grey cactus waiting for me. Feel in love from that day on. No issues with it in 5 weeks. I get looks and stopped weekly with questions. People go nuts and want my opinion. Only car I look at daily and drive that I havea huge smile. Love the 2.0 v4 turbo. It flies. Not a single regret and thank you ford for my love."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Ordered a lovely cyber orange color Bronco sport , production delays and i‚Äôm still waiting. 
I see stock car getting to dealers but not my customer order. It‚Äôs a fairly simple Badlands version with a tow package .
I found almost the same suv  just delivered to a dealer but without the tow package AND a $5000 over sticker cost! (Where‚Äôs mine?).
If I‚Äôm going to spend $40k on a vehicle I‚Äôm not buying off the lot and getting more or less that I want , I expect to have this car for 15 years as my retirement vehicle and don‚Äôt want to live with a compromise!
Fortunately I can wait. But it‚Äôs disappointing to see stock builds getting priority over a customer order. I guess Ford wants to protect their dealers who are struggling with lack of product to sell.
Maybe I can update this if I ever get to drive it!"

Bronco Sport,KBB,Good Looking
Bronco Sport,KBB,not reliable. Poor consumer experience from Ford
Bronco Sport,KBB,"The Bronco Sport is definitely cool looking but beware if something goes wrong. My BS went crazy while driving with all the dash lights shutting off and gave an error message on the navigation screen. The car wouldn't restart. Dealerships can't get it in until 2-6 weeks for diagnostics. And the warranty won't kick in to cover the rental car until diagnostics are done. Oh, and you know the dealers got greedy and sold all of their loaner cars. 2 weeks of rental car is over $1,000. This is the Ford way so beware. I should have stuck with the Japanese brands.  

The vehicle is nice to drive. Quality is okay. The steering wheel was horrible, had to get a cover for it. Some rattles that I asked about getting fixed months ago but again they said I would have to leave the car for 2 weeks."

Bronco Sport,KBB,"I have owned a whopping 85 vehicles in my life, and the Bronco FE is the very best I have owned. The ride for a OFF ROAD SUV type is way past my expectations and the fuel mileage I get somehow seems to be better than what is noted. Off road there are non that compare. I usually buy a truck and dream of my next purchase a couple of months later but that feeling is nowhere to be found and will always have this Bronco and others throughout the rest of my days. BUY ONE.."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Power, size, style"
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Auto start/stop, rear view wiper motor blind spot"
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I‚Äôve had my Bronco Sport for just over a year, but only driven 8500 miles with no long road trips yet.  I moved up from a 2009 Escape which I loved, but the Bronco is even better and more capable for rougher road conditions.  Perfect size for my needs.  Small enough for easy maneuvering and parking, but big enough to see over other traffic.  Enough room for me and a buddy and our outdoor gear.  Roof rack handles 2 kayaks easily.  Badlands edition with off road tires has plenty of power and still gets decent gas mileage (about 25 mpg combined).  Love the unique retro style that sets it apart from the sea of SUV‚Äôs.  Minor downsides: don‚Äôt care for the auto start/stop feature, and I‚Äôm still not in the habit of disabling it every time I start up.  Rear window wiper motor creates a blind spot.  Overall, very happy with this vehicle."

All weather cares and to close... 3cilinder + turbo = Power"
Bronco Sport,KBB,Great little sports truck and SO fun to drive!
Bronco Sport,KBB,None so far
Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is my first Ford and I‚Äôm impressed!  This vehicle handles great in snow & ice on the hills and the straightaway‚Äôs. I haven‚Äôt had one issue with this truck. And that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶ this truck is sooo cool looking! I get looks everywhere I go!! It gets pretty good gas mileage and the engine shut off at stop lights doesn‚Äôt bother me. I had a Lexus hybrid before I bought my baby Bronco (BIG step up for me) so I was sort of used to it. The Bronco Sport‚Äôs turn radius is super tight and I was amazed at how comfortable a ride it has.
I was lucky and found my Outer Banks on a lot. I got her for sticker price and she was loaded with all the bells and whistles- the only thing this one didn‚Äôt have that I sort of wanted was a moon roof. With the chip shortage that wasn‚Äôt possible at the time. 
I love Co-pilot 360 assist, remote start, the rubber floor mats, heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, rain sensing wipers, and the Bang & Olufsen stereo, etc. I can live without the moon roof. 
My interior is great quality and really cool looking!  I think the quality of the interior is excellent if you get the Outer Banks, Badlands or First Edition. If you get the base or Big Bend  models the interior is cheap. 
All in all, I think the Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks is an awesome vehicle and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to drive. Very comfortable.
Bronco Sport,KBB,No automated liftgate
Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is the best vehicle, by far, that I've ever owned. The comfort level, especially on long trips, is incredible. This vehicle is equipped with the Badlands package, just about everything you need. I say, ""just about"", because there is one thing it should come with, an automated rear lift gate. The power it has with the larger eco boost engine is awesome. Place this baby in sport mode and it gets crazy fast. My wife and I absolutely love this car."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Bronco Sport,KBB,None yet...
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Just purchased our Bronco Sport (Base) three weeks ago.  I've been enamored with the Bronco for quite some time and finally made the decision to purchase 'Sarge' and enjoy the unique Bronco Sport ownership experience.  I love this machine.  I purchased the Base model because it was the only one on the dealer's lot and the only one available to purchase within 200 miles.  The only other option was to order one and wait a year for delivery.  I'm not getting any younger, so when the dealer offered to drive the vehicle to me and perform the contract on the dining room table, I agreed and I'm glad I did.  As a caraholic, I've had many vehicles in my life and this Bronco is unique to any other I've owned; most of which were hot rods (Corvettes, Mustangs and a Shelby GT) or pickup trucks.  Because the Base model has no hi-tech options, I thought I would miss them, but I found that the 'Base Model' driving experience is much more enjoyable than I ever would have imagined.  I really wanted the 4-cylinder option, but settled for the 180 HP three banger since I had no other choice.  I'm not disappointed; however, because 'Sarge' (you can tell I'm a 30-year military guy) gets down the road and off road just fine.  In 'Eco' GOAT mode, I'm averaging 26 MGP which is pretty doggone good for a 4-wheel drive off-road oriented machine.  My wife's 2020 Escape (same chassis) provides a totally different driving experience in regards to comfort etc. Thus far, I'm quite pleased with the vehicle and my decision to purchase it.  If that changes, I'll let you know..."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Everything about it is perfect for me
Bronco Sport,KBB,Not one
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I absolutely love this car. I am an outdoorsy person and am in the mountains a lot. This offers everything I need in a car for my adventures. Its great at climbing (not hard-core climbing), its great in snow, its great on the highway. It offers amazing safety features and has already saved me from a collision with a deer on the highway with its auto braking system. It offers plenty of space for gear and extra passengers as well as my dogs. The convenience features are just phenomenal. The gas mileage is wonderful for its class. Its totally reliable and I know no matter where I am traveling we will be fine whether on the highway, off road, snow or rain we're safe and will get there without issue."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to drive and look at!
Bronco Sport,KBB,Soft top can be noisy at times
Bronco Sport,KBB,"After decades of waiting, the latest Ford bronco is 100% worth it. The technology package for on road driving is best in class and continues to amaze me every day. Adaptive cruise control, Lane keep assist, seat warmers, etc. don‚Äôt even scrape the surface of comfort. The off-road technology is even better, including 4H and 4L, and allowing you to disconnect stay bars, lock front and/or rear dif. And trail assist is fun too. Love the car!!!"

Also (and I think the most important) this vehicle somehow was able to ""see"" the lane lines on roads where they had been worn away. Despite me not being able to see the lane line's this vehicle kept me in my lane and kept me alert when competing for room on small roadways with 18 wheelers. I have driven Toyota's, Honda's, and even a Tesla. The Toyota had to be persuaded to Go, meaning I had to hit the gas several times to get it off the line. The Honda had multiple blind spots along it get up and go issues. The Tesla kept second-guessing my next move which would sometimes have it breaking on its own in the middle of the freeway. Even a year into owning this vehicle I have had no issues and cant up-talk this vehicle enough. Well done Ford!"
Bronco Sport,KBB,"incredibly fun, exellent off road , awsome styling"
Bronco Sport,KBB,bad intirior
Bronco Sport,KBB,"the new bronco is an exellent off roader suv and i love the fact that the roof is removable. i've seen the review of a bronco badlandsand it was awsome. the reason i din't give it five rating is because that is for even better cars like the land rover defender. this is a direct rival to the jeep wrangler and this frankly much cooler and much better than the wrangler. but the only flaw of the bronco is the intirior which is not all that good. there are cheap plastics everywhere which is not good espeacially for like $56,000 for the mid trim badlands. and wildtrack will be more expensive."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I‚Äôve only driven on city streets so far, but love the handling‚Äî steering feels like my old BMW‚Äî very stiff and great control. Just put 235/65r17 Falken Wildpeak AT3W on them for taking out to snowy mountain roads and they look and feel great."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I had a 18 honda crv and felt bored and everyone has one. This suv was definitely not the crown honda raves about.
Seen a bad lands 6 weeks ago and became obsessed. After looking I realized you cannot get one easy. 4 weeks, 118 miles and buying sight unseen or have driven one I bought it over the phone. This is not me or my personality. I crewed off every finger nail till I got to the dealership. I seen my grey cactus waiting for me. Feel in love from that day on. No issues with it in 5 weeks. I get looks and stopped weekly with questions. People go nuts and want my opinion. Only car I look at daily and drive that I havea huge smile. Love the 2.0 v4 turbo. It flies. Not a single regret and thank you ford for my love."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Ordered a lovely cyber orange color Bronco sport , production delays and i‚Äôm still waiting. 
I see stock car getting to dealers but not my customer order. It‚Äôs a fairly simple Badlands version with a tow package .
I found almost the same suv  just delivered to a dealer but without the tow package AND a $5000 over sticker cost! (Where‚Äôs mine?).
If I‚Äôm going to spend $40k on a vehicle I‚Äôm not buying off the lot and getting more or less that I want , I expect to have this car for 15 years as my retirement vehicle and don‚Äôt want to live with a compromise!
Fortunately I can wait. But it‚Äôs disappointing to see stock builds getting priority over a customer order. I guess Ford wants to protect their dealers who are struggling with lack of product to sell.
Maybe I can update this if I ever get to drive it!"

Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun. Unique. Awesome Ride.
Bronco Sport,KBB,Cabin noise
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Awesome fun. Road Trip tested.  24,000 miles and 11 states so far.  Zero issues.  7 speed Manual shifts easy. Plenty of power from 2.3L engine.

Area 51 gets lots of compliments.   Hard top is nice and looks good."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Good Looking
Bronco Sport,KBB,not reliable. Poor consumer experience from Ford
Bronco Sport,KBB,"The Bronco Sport is definitely cool looking but beware if something goes wrong. My BS went crazy while driving with all the dash lights shutting off and gave an error message on the navigation screen. The car wouldn't restart. Dealerships can't get it in until 2-6 weeks for diagnostics. And the warranty won't kick in to cover the rental car until diagnostics are done. Oh, and you know the dealers got greedy and sold all of their loaner cars. 2 weeks of rental car is over $1,000. This is the Ford way so beware. I should have stuck with the Japanese brands.  

The vehicle is nice to drive. Quality is okay. The steering wheel was horrible, had to get a cover for it. Some rattles that I asked about getting fixed months ago but again they said I would have to leave the car for 2 weeks."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Extremely fun..period
Bronco Sport,KBB,They don‚Äôt make the diesel YET
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I have owned a whopping 85 vehicles in my life, and the Bronco FE is the very best I have owned. The ride for a OFF ROAD SUV type is way past my expectations and the fuel mileage I get somehow seems to be better than what is noted. Off road there are non that compare. I usually buy a truck and dream of my next purchase a couple of months later but that feeling is nowhere to be found and will always have this Bronco and others throughout the rest of my days. BUY ONE.."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Power, size, style"
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Auto start/stop, rear view wiper motor blind spot"
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I‚Äôve had my Bronco Sport for just over a year, but only driven 8500 miles with no long road trips yet.  I moved up from a 2009 Escape which I loved, but the Bronco is even better and more capable for rougher road conditions.  Perfect size for my needs.  Small enough for easy maneuvering and parking, but big enough to see over other traffic.  Enough room for me and a buddy and our outdoor gear.  Roof rack handles 2 kayaks easily.  Badlands edition with off road tires has plenty of power and still gets decent gas mileage (about 25 mpg combined).  Love the unique retro style that sets it apart from the sea of SUV‚Äôs.  Minor downsides: don‚Äôt care for the auto start/stop feature, and I‚Äôm still not in the habit of disabling it every time I start up.  Rear window wiper motor creates a blind spot.  Overall, very happy with this vehicle."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to Drive
Bronco Sport,KBB,Small Back Leg Room but not a big issue
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Is a kind of SUV that you said nice...but when you enter this vehicle you WOW!!! Have every single detail to get everything! I run for 3 hours (120 miles ride) and just take les than a quarter of the gas thank. Is comfort, AutoPilot, 360 camera, nice audio system and a freaking table in the back!! All weather cares and to close... 3cilinder + turbo = Power"
Bronco Sport,KBB,Great little sports truck and SO fun to drive!
Bronco Sport,KBB,None so far
Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is my first Ford and I‚Äôm impressed!  This vehicle handles great in snow & ice on the hills and the straightaway‚Äôs. I haven‚Äôt had one issue with this truck. And that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶ this truck is sooo cool looking! I get looks everywhere I go!! It gets pretty good gas mileage and the engine shut off at stop lights doesn‚Äôt bother me. I had a Lexus hybrid before I bought my baby Bronco (BIG step up for me) so I was sort of used to it. The Bronco Sport‚Äôs turn radius is super tight and I was amazed at how comfortable a ride it has.
I was lucky and found my Outer Banks on a lot. I got her for sticker price and she was loaded with all the bells and whistles- the only thing this one didn‚Äôt have that I sort of wanted was a moon roof. With the chip shortage that wasn‚Äôt possible at the time. 
I love Co-pilot 360 assist, remote start, the rubber floor mats, heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, rain sensing wipers, and the Bang & Olufsen stereo, etc. I can live without the moon roof. 
My interior is great quality and really cool looking!  I think the quality of the interior is excellent if you get the Outer Banks, Badlands or First Edition. If you get the base or Big Bend  models the interior is cheap. 
All in all, I think the Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks is an awesome vehicle and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to drive. Very comfortable.
Bronco Sport,KBB,No automated liftgate
Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is the best vehicle, by far, that I've ever owned. The comfort level, especially on long trips, is incredible. This vehicle is equipped with the Badlands package, just about everything you need. I say, ""just about"", because there is one thing it should come with, an automated rear lift gate. The power it has with the larger eco boost engine is awesome. Place this baby in sport mode and it gets crazy fast. My wife and I absolutely love this car."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Bronco Sport,KBB,None yet...
Bronco Sport,KBB,"Just purchased our Bronco Sport (Base) three weeks ago.  I've been enamored with the Bronco for quite some time and finally made the decision to purchase 'Sarge' and enjoy the unique Bronco Sport ownership experience.  I love this machine.  I purchased the Base model because it was the only one on the dealer's lot and the only one available to purchase within 200 miles.  The only other option was to order one and wait a year for delivery.  I'm not getting any younger, so when the dealer offered to drive the vehicle to me and perform the contract on the dining room table, I agreed and I'm glad I did.  As a caraholic, I've had many vehicles in my life and this Bronco is unique to any other I've owned; most of which were hot rods (Corvettes, Mustangs and a Shelby GT) or pickup trucks.  Because the Base model has no hi-tech options, I thought I would miss them, but I found that the 'Base Model' driving experience is much more enjoyable than I ever would have imagined.  I really wanted the 4-cylinder option, but settled for the 180 HP three banger since I had no other choice.  I'm not disappointed; however, because 'Sarge' (you can tell I'm a 30-year military guy) gets down the road and off road just fine.  In 'Eco' GOAT mode, I'm averaging 26 MGP which is pretty doggone good for a 4-wheel drive off-road oriented machine.  My wife's 2020 Escape (same chassis) provides a totally different driving experience in regards to comfort etc. Thus far, I'm quite pleased with the vehicle and my decision to purchase it.  If that changes, I'll let you know..."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Everything about it is perfect for me
Bronco Sport,KBB,Not one
Bronco Sport,KBB,"I absolutely love this car. I am an outdoorsy person and am in the mountains a lot. This offers everything I need in a car for my adventures. Its great at climbing (not hard-core climbing), its great in snow, its great on the highway. It offers amazing safety features and has already saved me from a collision with a deer on the highway with its auto braking system. It offers plenty of space for gear and extra passengers as well as my dogs. The convenience features are just phenomenal. The gas mileage is wonderful for its class. Its totally reliable and I know no matter where I am traveling we will be fine whether on the highway, off road, snow or rain we're safe and will get there without issue."
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to drive and look at!
Bronco Sport,KBB,Soft top can be noisy at times
Bronco Sport,KBB,"After decades of waiting, the latest Ford bronco is 100% worth it. The technology package for on road driving is best in class and continues to amaze me every day. Adaptive cruise control, Lane keep assist, seat warmers, etc. don‚Äôt even scrape the surface of comfort. The off-road technology is even better, including 4H and 4L, and allowing you to disconnect stay bars, lock front and/or rear dif. And trail assist is fun too. Love the car!!!"
Bronco Sport,KBB,Fun to drive
Bronco Sport,KBB,Engine pausing at stop
Bronco Sport,KBB,Comfortable and reliable.  Great seating capacity.  Easy access to rear trunk area.
Bronco Sport,KBB,Very enjoyable to drive and ride!!
Bronco Sport,KBB,automatic engine shutoff.
Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is the 3rd ""Bronco"" model I have owned.    I love the look of the vehicle. I am a big man and I am very comfortable in short and long drives.  I am impressed by the get up and go it has.
One small annoyance is the automatic engine shutoff.  I disable it every time I drive.  I would like to be able to disable full time."
Bronco Sport,KBB,"smooth, get up and go, a beast"

CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None

CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."

So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.

CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.

I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,"Nice and confortable little SUV, just what I was"
CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix.

   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it."
CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time."

CR-V,KBB,Noisy when going over bumps
CR-V,KBB,I bought my 2022 HRV white four wheel drive in September 2021. The only complaint I have is that whenever going over a bump is really noisy. Otherwise the car is easy to handle and I love everything else about the car. Just what I was looking for.
CR-V,KBB,Excellent design. 1.5L turbo 4 cylinder a must.
CR-V,KBB,Cabin sound level. Fuel economy not as advertized
CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?"
CR-V,KBB,I enjoyed the heated seats and driving it.
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,"Excellent car, it just about drives it self. No issues with it.
It has self control lights which I love so you don't have to mess with them. Great seats contours to your back so it helps on a long trip. Amazing car."
CR-V,KBB,"Great mileage ,, peppy great driviving car‚Ä¶"
CR-V,KBB,Could use updated computer screen
CR-V,KBB,Love this car‚Ä¶my second one‚Ä¶best bang for your buck. I‚Äôm not a big or tall guy and fit very comfortably in drivers seat.. I got the EX middle of the line model and the price was excellent and affordable‚Ä¶just have what I need and use daily‚Ä¶
CR-V,KBB,I just Love The Honda CRV's really good gas mi.
CR-V,KBB,Quiet Ride With Pep To It!!
CR-V,KBB,"I Just recently bought this car after getting rid of my 2018 CRV EX the turned out to be a Lemon.
So what did I do I got back in the race and bought a new 2022 CRV EXL this car is fully loaded with all the EXTRAS & as luck would have it I was able to get a car with very close in color.
It has all the Bells & Whistles and I can con only hope what I have been told that the 2022 CRV'S 
are much improved over the 2018 CRV. Well so lets hope as I didn't much of a choice sine the Dealership bought my 2018 I was told I would have to buy a 2022 so that's What I did.
After driving it a just a bit I can tell this is not the same car as the 2018 they have truly made some great improvements. I just hope this feeling is right sine this car cost me allot more then my 2018."
CR-V,KBB,I live in Northern Wisconsin with some extreme winter temperatures. At 6600 miles our CRV started to sound louder than normal. I checked the oil and it was way above full due to gas in the oil. I would avoid the 1.5 turbo engine if you live in a cold climate. Also the exhaust system accumulates so much water it creates  other problems.
CR-V,KBB,"This is the perfect car for me with a lot of safety features. It is a safe car and helps me be a safer driver. It's easy to get in and out, comfortable adjustable seats. The things I miss from my last car are remote control start-up and cd player."
CR-V,KBB,"Super peppy, 35-40 mpg"
CR-V,KBB,No ventilated seats
CR-V,KBB,"It is easily the best all-around vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.  Affordable price, upscale interior, very roomy 2nd-row, immense cargo space, quick and quiet power, handles nicely, 35-40 mpg.  I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice."
CR-V,KBB,nice car for it's class. My only concern is the engine size which is too small and very noisy but it does the job. I like the tech of this car which is very advanced for it's class.
CR-V,KBB,"Gas mileage, safety, comfort"
CR-V,KBB,Update engine shutoff
CR-V,KBB,"Pleased with CR-V Touring, just don't like engine shutting off at every stop, just wish they would update shutoff button that would disable engine to shut when you want it to, otherwise you have to shut it off every time you turn car on."
CR-V,KBB,great road car
CR-V,KBB,none
CR-V,KBB,This car cannot be improved. It is perfect! I would buy another in a flash. Honda makes a GREAT vehicle.
CR-V,KBB,The added luxuries. The stereo is really loud/good
CR-V,KBB,The wheels in the front are loud.
CR-V,KBB,"I own a Touring so it‚Äôs fully loaded. I love my sun roof. I have added things in the car such as; TVs in the head rest, car locator, radar detector, electric and a car starter. I have owned the car for six months and completely love it. I call it my Mercedes. Things that scare me is lane assist and the braking system when it to detects that you‚Äôre not driving safely. So far I would not change anything about this car and I‚Äôve had no problems. However, I did get the extended warranty not everybody could afford it though. But I would definitely recommend it."
CR-V,KBB,As stated above
CR-V,KBB,None
CR-V,KBB,Never had any problems with this car.  Handled very well in snow and rain. Very comfortable and fun to drive and got 32 Mpg. Just got hit from behind and was in rollover accident on the highway  that totaled my car. All 6 airbags deployed. My daughter and I walked away from it without any injuries.
CR-V,KBB,Smooth ride and comfortable seating
CR-V,KBB,No Blind Spot Monitor
CR-V,KBB,"I have bought Honda CRV LX in the past and this year' model of 2022 is also very good.  It rides very smoothly and has all the updated features of new cars, with the exception of Blind Spot Monitor which is only available on the EX.  Otherwise it' a very comfortable car with lots of space and storage in the back with seats that fold down for extra room.  This car also has AWD and  mileage is decent"
CR-V,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
CR-V,KBB,Electrical... all of the electrical
CR-V,KBB,"I have not had any issues with the mechanical parts of this car; just the usual maintenance.  I have had to bring it into the shop for multiple electrical issues in the past year alone.  Be prepared to change your batter every year or two.  I've had issues with batteries, a/c control center, and now the entire safety suite is going haywire.  I will probably trade this car in and get something completely different.  This has put me off of buying a Honda ever again."
Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the ‚Äúdual clutch transmission‚Äù (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ‚Äúsafercar‚Äù web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

Tucson,KBB,None
Tucson,KBB,Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
Tucson,KBB,"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Tucson,KBB,Looks nice
Tucson,KBB,Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
Tucson,KBB,"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
Tucson,KBB,"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"

Tucson,KBB,Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
Tucson,KBB,"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn‚Äôt apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
Tucson,KBB,"Utilitarian, practical"
Tucson,KBB,"Wind noise, MPG"
Tucson,KBB,"I own the 2021 Tucson. I‚Äôm really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don‚Äôt mind the plastic interior. It‚Äôs easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm treating it badly. I can‚Äôt see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It‚Äôs really about preference. I‚Äôve owned a Hyundai before so I‚Äôm comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
Tucson,KBB,"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
Tucson,KBB,"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter‚Äôs Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn‚Äôt even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can‚Äôt complain about the dealer‚Äôs service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can‚Äôt afford to trade it without losing money."

I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
Tucson,KBB,No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."

The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the ‚Äúdual clutch transmission‚Äù (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ‚Äúsafercar‚Äù web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

Tucson,KBB,"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
Tucson,KBB,None
Tucson,KBB,Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
Tucson,KBB,"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Tucson,KBB,Looks nice
Tucson,KBB,Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
Tucson,KBB,"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
Tucson,KBB,"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"

Tucson,KBB,Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
Tucson,KBB,"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn‚Äôt apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
Tucson,KBB,"Utilitarian, practical"
Tucson,KBB,"Wind noise, MPG"
Tucson,KBB,"I own the 2021 Tucson. I‚Äôm really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don‚Äôt mind the plastic interior. It‚Äôs easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm treating it badly. I can‚Äôt see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It‚Äôs really about preference. I‚Äôve owned a Hyundai before so I‚Äôm comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
Tucson,KBB,"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
Tucson,KBB,"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter‚Äôs Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn‚Äôt even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can‚Äôt complain about the dealer‚Äôs service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can‚Äôt afford to trade it without losing money."
Tucson,KBB,Drive smoothly
Tucson,KBB,No cons
Tucson,KBB,Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.

Tucson,KBB,"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate.

I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."

Tucson,KBB,NICE LOOKING
Tucson,KBB,NOT RELIABLE
Tucson,KBB,THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue!

Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.

Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."

Tucson,KBB,"Very intuitive Car! Beautiful car styling and love the mohave sand color. Power everything, and the automatic lift hatchback is amazing. Everything about this car is smooth.

Tucson,KBB,NICE LOOKING
Tucson,KBB,NOT RELIABLE
Tucson,KBB,THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the ‚Äúdual clutch transmission‚Äù (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ‚Äúsafercar‚Äù web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

Tucson,KBB,"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
Tucson,KBB,None
Tucson,KBB,Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
Tucson,KBB,"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Tucson,KBB,Looks nice
Tucson,KBB,Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
Tucson,KBB,"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
Tucson,KBB,"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"
Tucson,KBB,Value
Tucson,KBB,Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!
Tucson,KBB,It‚Äôs a very luxurious car
Tucson,KBB,Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
Tucson,KBB,"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn‚Äôt apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
Tucson,KBB,"Utilitarian, practical"
Tucson,KBB,"Wind noise, MPG"
Tucson,KBB,"I own the 2021 Tucson. I‚Äôm really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don‚Äôt mind the plastic interior. It‚Äôs easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm treating it badly. I can‚Äôt see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It‚Äôs really about preference. I‚Äôve owned a Hyundai before so I‚Äôm comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
Tucson,KBB,"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
Tucson,KBB,"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter‚Äôs Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn‚Äôt even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can‚Äôt complain about the dealer‚Äôs service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can‚Äôt afford to trade it without losing money."
Tucson,KBB,Drive smoothly
Tucson,KBB,No cons
Tucson,KBB,Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.

Tucson,KBB,Radio speakers are not good...
Tucson,KBB,"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."

They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."

Tucson,KBB,Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!

Tucson,KBB,Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
Tucson,KBB,"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn‚Äôt apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
Tucson,KBB,"Utilitarian, practical"
Tucson,KBB,"Wind noise, MPG"
Tucson,KBB,"I own the 2021 Tucson. I‚Äôm really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don‚Äôt mind the plastic interior. It‚Äôs easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm treating it badly. I can‚Äôt see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It‚Äôs really about preference. I‚Äôve owned a Hyundai before so I‚Äôm comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
Tucson,KBB,"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
Tucson,KBB,"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter‚Äôs Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn‚Äôt even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can‚Äôt complain about the dealer‚Äôs service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can‚Äôt afford to trade it without losing money."
Tucson,KBB,Drive smoothly

Tucson,KBB,"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
Tucson,KBB,No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."

Tucson,KBB,NICE LOOKING
Tucson,KBB,NOT RELIABLE
Tucson,KBB,THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the ‚Äúdual clutch transmission‚Äù (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ‚Äúsafercar‚Äù web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

Tucson,KBB,"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."

There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the ‚Äúdual clutch transmission‚Äù (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ‚Äúsafercar‚Äù web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

Tucson,KBB,I still owe that much.  Value should be higher.  Could not sell for that. Hardly used at all.  Only owner is 80 years old
Tucson,KBB,"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
Tucson,KBB,None
Tucson,KBB,Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
Tucson,KBB,"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Tucson,KBB,Looks nice
Tucson,KBB,Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
Tucson,KBB,"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
Tucson,KBB,"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"

Tucson,KBB,Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
Tucson,KBB,"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn‚Äôt apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
Tucson,KBB,"Utilitarian, practical"
Tucson,KBB,"Wind noise, MPG"
Tucson,KBB,"I own the 2021 Tucson. I‚Äôm really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don‚Äôt mind the plastic interior. It‚Äôs easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm treating it badly. I can‚Äôt see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It‚Äôs really about preference. I‚Äôve owned a Hyundai before so I‚Äôm comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
Tucson,KBB,"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
Tucson,KBB,"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter‚Äôs Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn‚Äôt even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can‚Äôt complain about the dealer‚Äôs service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can‚Äôt afford to trade it without losing money."
Tucson,KBB,Drive smoothly
Tucson,KBB,No cons
Tucson,KBB,Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.
Tucson,KBB,"Fast and nimble, great gas mileage; 37 mpg highway"
Tucson,KBB,Radio speakers are not good...
Tucson,KBB,"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
Tucson,KBB,No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."

Sportage,KBB,"Test drove the , CR-V, CX-9, VW Alltrack & Touareg , Tucson, Outback, Rouge, Escape & Rav4. The KIA Sportage SX was the best combination of quality, power and handling. This vehicle is just so fun to drive!
Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode. My highway numbers since then are still around 26-27 mpg on shorter trips.

Buying a KIA was not in my plans when I started my shopping process but all those test drives opened my eyes, KIA has really stepped up its game!"

Sportage,KBB,Wind noise at highway speeds
Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features."

Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode. My highway numbers since then are still around 26-27 mpg on shorter trips.

Buying a KIA was not in my plans when I started my shopping process but all those test drives opened my eyes, KIA has really stepped up its game!"

Sportage,KBB,Wind noise at highway speeds
Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features."
Sportage,KBB,This vehicle feels sporty to drive in sports mode
Sportage,KBB,not as quiet as a cadillac but not bad
Sportage,KBB,"Don't get me wrong, 99 percent of people will probably find this car comfortable enough for them but at 6-3 and 300 Lb's its a little too cramped. The car has plenty of power and is surprisingly nimble considering it is not a sports car. The turbo edition is definitely  worth the extra money as is the all wheel drive. The AWD makes it handle really well when we get those huge rains here in Florida."

Sportage,KBB,This car is great except for there is no cd player and no way to turn the heat/air completely off which makes for a very uncomfortable ride.  Have to have either heat or air on at all times.  Sunroof does not allow any air to come in unless you have it all the way open.  Without the heat/air and no cd player the car could score all 5's.

Sportage,KBB,Thieves like it too
Sportage,KBB,"Love my Sportage! She's perfect in the snow, heading up to the mountains for camping trips, fits multiple grown 6 feet tall adult men with room to spare. 
I love all the different driving modes, the headlights. It is incredibly comfortable and the 'driver-centric design makes you feel like you're driving a sports car.
My one gripe about this car is it is notoriously easy to steal. 
I didn't realize it until mine was stolen last week and I googled 'Kia Sportage thefts' - the stories about people who had theirs stolen were endless. 
Kia (and Hyundai) are quickly climbing up the ranks as one of the most stolen car brands due to the key fob and ignition issues. 
Buy the car, but negotiate for an aftermarket alarm & GPS or be prepared to purchase your own!"

Love the sunroof, but don't use it as much as I thought I would. Front seats are a bit hard, and take some adjusting to get used to, but the heated/cooled portion works well. This car feels like a car that costs thousands more. Gets an easy 27mpg at highway speeds with full passengers.

Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features."
Sportage,KBB,This vehicle feels sporty to drive in sports mode
Sportage,KBB,not as quiet as a cadillac but not bad
Sportage,KBB,"Don't get me wrong, 99 percent of people will probably find this car comfortable enough for them but at 6-3 and 300 Lb's its a little too cramped. The car has plenty of power and is surprisingly nimble considering it is not a sports car. The turbo edition is definitely  worth the extra money as is the all wheel drive. The AWD makes it handle really well when we get those huge rains here in Florida."

Sportage,KBB,Fun to drive
Sportage,KBB,Heating system
Sportage,KBB,This car is great except for there is no cd player and no way to turn the heat/air completely off which makes for a very uncomfortable ride.  Have to have either heat or air on at all times.  Sunroof does not allow any air to come in unless you have it all the way open.  Without the heat/air and no cd player the car could score all 5's.
Sportage,KBB,"Excellent leg and head room, I am 6' 3"" tall, Impressive acceleration. cruises effortlessly at high speed , very little wind noise and gets good gas mileage. Have not required 1 trip to the shop for any repair etc."
Sportage,KBB,Great looking SUV
Sportage,KBB,"Very reliable, comfortable to drive.  Feels smooth, like driving a car, but has the extra space advantage an SUV.  Handles well in all kinds of weather."

Sportage,KBB,Thieves like it too
Sportage,KBB,"Love my Sportage! She's perfect in the snow, heading up to the mountains for camping trips, fits multiple grown 6 feet tall adult men with room to spare. 
I love all the different driving modes, the headlights. It is incredibly comfortable and the 'driver-centric design makes you feel like you're driving a sports car.
My one gripe about this car is it is notoriously easy to steal. 
I didn't realize it until mine was stolen last week and I googled 'Kia Sportage thefts' - the stories about people who had theirs stolen were endless. 
Kia (and Hyundai) are quickly climbing up the ranks as one of the most stolen car brands due to the key fob and ignition issues. 
Buy the car, but negotiate for an aftermarket alarm & GPS or be prepared to purchase your own!"
Sportage,KBB,Easy to drive and it looks good.
Sportage,KBB,The recalls were a concern. Dealership fixed it.

Sportage,KBB,I like the vehicles looks but was amazed at the ride and comfort on my test drive. This vehicle is appears to be a great value for someone like myself that does not want to pay a premium for a premium vehicle. The Sportage show great sporty character on the exterior and has a upgrade look at the interior even in the base model.
Sportage,KBB,"Fun to drive, and feels luxurious."
Sportage,KBB,"Hard front seats, no memory on seats/mirrors"
Sportage,KBB,"Smooth and quiet, and feels like quality. Not like the old pre-2010 Kias. Uses soft materials and good technology to enhance the drivers experience. 2.0L turbo will get up and scoot! daily driven around town and taken on 4 longer trips (1200+ miles). Still feels new! Love the sunroof, but don't use it as much as I thought I would. Front seats are a bit hard, and take some adjusting to get used to, but the heated/cooled portion works well. This car feels like a car that costs thousands more. Gets an easy 27mpg at highway speeds with full passengers. The only thing I would add is a seat/mirror memory option, so that it is easily returned to its settings after my wife uses the car. A car of this class should have that option. Otherwise love it."
Sportage,KBB,"Test drove the , CR-V, CX-9, VW Alltrack & Touareg , Tucson, Outback, Rouge, Escape & Rav4. The KIA Sportage SX was the best combination of quality, power and handling. This vehicle is just so fun to drive!
Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode. My highway numbers since then are still around 26-27 mpg on shorter trips.

Buying a KIA was not in my plans when I started my shopping process but all those test drives opened my eyes, KIA has really stepped up its game!"
Sportage,KBB,It's a great vehicle but the Kia customer service is extremely poor on all levels.

Never should have wasted my money on the exterior protection which is absolutely ridiculous with exclusions.  I do not advise anyone to purchase this exterior protection.  It‚Äôs COSTLY and the company of product doesn‚Äôt stand by product where I am concerned. Dealerships get a big kick back for selling."

Sportage,KBB,Wind noise at highway speeds
Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds.

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

CX-5,KBB,Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
CX-5,KBB,Everything
CX-5,KBB,The small exhaust tips
CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
CX-5,KBB,"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I‚Äôm good to go. It‚Äôs a great car."
CX-5,KBB,Sharp driving experience
CX-5,KBB,Bose only on highest trim levels
CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls -

CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"

CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

CX-5,KBB,"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
CX-5,KBB,"I have the turbo and it‚Äôs a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
CX-5,KBB,"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
CX-5,KBB,Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
CX-5,KBB,Everything
CX-5,KBB,The small exhaust tips
CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
CX-5,KBB,"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I‚Äôm good to go. It‚Äôs a great car."
CX-5,KBB,Sharp driving experience
CX-5,KBB,Bose only on highest trim levels
CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.

This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

CX-5,KBB,Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
CX-5,KBB,Everything
CX-5,KBB,The small exhaust tips
CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
CX-5,KBB,"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I‚Äôm good to go. It‚Äôs a great car."
CX-5,KBB,Sharp driving experience
CX-5,KBB,Bose only on highest trim levels
CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
CX-5,KBB,Everything!
CX-5,KBB,Nothing
CX-5,KBB,I absolutely love this crossover!!! It‚Äôs definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive definitely
CX-5,KBB,Interior space
CX-5,KBB,"I took the base model, and I‚Äôm fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it‚Äôs the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
CX-5,KBB,"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
CX-5,KBB,"This car does great in the snow! It‚Äôs comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."

CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."

CX-5,KBB,"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
CX-5,KBB,"This car does great in the snow! It‚Äôs comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

CX-5,KBB,"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
CX-5,KBB,Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
CX-5,KBB,Everything

CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."

CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

CX-5,KBB,"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
CX-5,KBB,Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
CX-5,KBB,Everything
CX-5,KBB,The small exhaust tips
CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
CX-5,KBB,"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I‚Äôm good to go. It‚Äôs a great car."
CX-5,KBB,Sharp driving experience
CX-5,KBB,Bose only on highest trim levels
CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"

With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
CX-5,KBB,"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn‚Äôt terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10‚Äù+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it‚Äôs intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone‚Äôs GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don‚Äôt like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle‚Äôs interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they‚Äôre cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for ‚Äúcupping‚Äù (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that‚Äôs sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn‚Äôt change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021‚Äôs were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I‚Äôve seen lack the Bose."
CX-5,KBB,Sporty interior and exterior. Options
CX-5,KBB,A little underpowered
CX-5,KBB,I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
CX-5,KBB,Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
CX-5,KBB,Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
CX-5,KBB,"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."

CX-5,KBB,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I‚Äôve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
CX-5,KBB,"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I‚Äôm good to go. It‚Äôs a great car."

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles .

Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around .

The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
CX-5,KBB,Everything!
CX-5,KBB,Nothing
CX-5,KBB,I absolutely love this crossover!!! It‚Äôs definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive definitely
CX-5,KBB,Interior space
CX-5,KBB,"I took the base model, and I‚Äôm fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it‚Äôs the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
CX-5,KBB,"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
CX-5,KBB,"This car does great in the snow! It‚Äôs comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats‚ÄîI would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
CX-5,KBB,Drives like a sports car
CX-5,KBB,Conservative space behind the back seat
CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it‚Äôs gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don‚Äôt. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4‚Äù display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn‚Äôt have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got‚Ä¶and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats‚Ä¶not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn‚Äôt handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
CX-5,KBB,Everything!
CX-5,KBB,Nothing
CX-5,KBB,I absolutely love this crossover!!! It‚Äôs definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive definitely
CX-5,KBB,Interior space
CX-5,KBB,"I took the base model, and I‚Äôm fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it‚Äôs the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
CX-5,KBB,"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
CX-5,KBB,"This car does great in the snow! It‚Äôs comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
CX-5,KBB,Fun to Drive
CX-5,KBB,Excessive oil consumption
CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
CX-5,KBB,"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
CX-5,KBB,Compact suv
CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec‚Äôs. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it‚Äôs perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane
+250 dollar donation to Make a Wish Foundation

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle."
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created."
Forester,KBB,Showing 15 of 60 reviews.
Forester,KBB,Elegant and fun to drive.
Forester,KBB,I can‚Äôt think of any. I love this car.
Forester,KBB,"I am a loyal Subaru fan, and went from an Outback to a Forester.  Love this car because it is comfortable with plenty of room and stylish.  A plus is that it is a beast in the snow.  Love the softer seats and so easy to clean.  Wish Subaru would come out with a hybrid model for better gas mileage."
Forester,KBB,Saftey and Quality
Forester,KBB,Tire vibration(Brand?)
Forester,KBB,"This car is very 'features rich'.  I traded my 2017 in for more safety features, especially Rear Auto Braking, and braking in front.  The lane departure feature is good, but not necessary in all cases. 
The mileage per gallon is what I expected. Much better than my 2013 Kia Soul.  The vehicle has everything I need, and many other things.  I love it!!"
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable car, Touring model with top features, lightly driven during pandemic, in excellent condition."
Forester,KBB,"Comfortable, fuel economy, awd, reliability"
Forester,KBB,Some safety features were a bit confusing at first
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable,  good fuel economy, great winter driver. Have owned both the Rav4 and CRV and the Forester has won me over. I looked at all 3 prior to my purchase, test drove, read research, etc on each before deciding. Coming from owning both Toyotas and Hondas, it was a leap of faith as I had great experiences with both. Looking back, glad I made the change. No regrets."
Forester,KBB,"So pretty, everyone comments on it. Love Subarus!"
Forester,KBB,There are no cons. It's comfortable driving long
Forester,KBB,Had to get larger car to enable disabled husband get in the vehicle.  He can't bend his legs to get in & out.
Forester,KBB,"AWD, driver assistance, infotainment"
Forester,KBB,Pricy
Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version."
Forester,KBB,Loaded with advanced features.
Forester,KBB,Radio is good. Gas economy far from advertised especially city driving. Outside features are very nice except the looks. Long and narrow. Not very stable on the road if compare to my Mazda CX-5.
Forester,KBB,Excellent visibility
Forester,KBB,Very weak engine
Forester,KBB,"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Forester,KBB,Reliable
Forester,KBB,"Slow, noisy engine"
Forester,KBB,"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
Forester,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Forester,KBB,Some radio issues
Forester,KBB,"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Forester,KBB,Gas mileage great easy getting in and out
Forester,KBB,"Cup holder location, auto shut off, viberation"
Forester,KBB,"Car has a vibration in seats and floor, had 4 sets of tires, rims changed, new drive shaft, Axiel change out been with dealer over 30 days wait wait wait"
Forester,KBB,"Most dependable, great to drive."
Forester,KBB,"A wire burn-up under the driver seat, unsure why?"
Forester,KBB,"This car was purchased for the wife, she loves it. She'd like to buy another Forester but not many available to match this one. Looking for a 2021. She'd like the rea pwr. gate with her next purchase. I like the car also, it's a fun drive and has all the equip. needed for a 2nd get-around car. We have taken good care of this car and will miss it. It's just time to trade up."
Forester,KBB,It basically drives itself
Forester,KBB,Engine auto shut off is loud and gets annoying
Forester,KBB,"This is the first new car I‚Äôve ever owned, and with this model, it‚Äôs actually been a great investment. I love it so much, tho, I couldn‚Äôt imagine selling it."
Forester,KBB,Quality brand in every respect.
Forester,KBB,Interior could be a bit more plush.
Forester,KBB,"First, I‚Äôve owned eight Subarus! Why you ask? Reliability, dependability, safety, quality and fuel economy for a full time AWD vehicle. Having lived in WV most all my 67 years, I can attest to the capabilities Subaru puts into their cars. Come snow, rain and whatever else, Subaru comes through every single time. And my 2021 Forester Limited takes us wherever and back safely while sipping fuel at an average of 28-32 MPG! Fit and finish are exceptionally good and the cabin, while not super fancy, is quiet and comfortable. Subarus price point is very reasonable for their top of the line Forester. If you are looking for a vehicle that can do it all, I suggest you at least test drive one. You‚Äôll be surprised and hooked at the same time! Happy trails."
Forester,KBB,Top of the line with every safety feature
Forester,KBB,audio system
Forester,KBB,"2019 Subaru ForesterTouring - So many safety features, ""all wheel"" drive, fit and finish is top of the line, audio system is below par, value is better than almost any car on the market, white is the best color for the market."

It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created."

Forester,KBB,Elegant and fun to drive.
Forester,KBB,I can‚Äôt think of any. I love this car.
Forester,KBB,"I am a loyal Subaru fan, and went from an Outback to a Forester.  Love this car because it is comfortable with plenty of room and stylish.  A plus is that it is a beast in the snow.  Love the softer seats and so easy to clean.  Wish Subaru would come out with a hybrid model for better gas mileage."
Forester,KBB,Saftey and Quality
Forester,KBB,Tire vibration(Brand?)
Forester,KBB,"This car is very 'features rich'.  I traded my 2017 in for more safety features, especially Rear Auto Braking, and braking in front.  The lane departure feature is good, but not necessary in all cases. 
The mileage per gallon is what I expected. Much better than my 2013 Kia Soul.  The vehicle has everything I need, and many other things.  I love it!!"
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable car, Touring model with top features, lightly driven during pandemic, in excellent condition."
Forester,KBB,"Comfortable, fuel economy, awd, reliability"
Forester,KBB,Some safety features were a bit confusing at first
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable,  good fuel economy, great winter driver. Have owned both the Rav4 and CRV and the Forester has won me over. I looked at all 3 prior to my purchase, test drove, read research, etc on each before deciding. Coming from owning both Toyotas and Hondas, it was a leap of faith as I had great experiences with both. Looking back, glad I made the change. No regrets."
Forester,KBB,"So pretty, everyone comments on it. Love Subarus!"
Forester,KBB,There are no cons. It's comfortable driving long
Forester,KBB,Had to get larger car to enable disabled husband get in the vehicle.  He can't bend his legs to get in & out.
Forester,KBB,"AWD, driver assistance, infotainment"
Forester,KBB,Pricy
Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version."
Forester,KBB,Loaded with advanced features.
Forester,KBB,Radio is good. Gas economy far from advertised especially city driving. Outside features are very nice except the looks. Long and narrow. Not very stable on the road if compare to my Mazda CX-5.
Forester,KBB,Excellent visibility
Forester,KBB,Very weak engine
Forester,KBB,"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Forester,KBB,Reliable
Forester,KBB,"Slow, noisy engine"
Forester,KBB,"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
Forester,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Forester,KBB,Some radio issues
Forester,KBB,"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Forester,KBB,Gas mileage great easy getting in and out
Forester,KBB,"Cup holder location, auto shut off, viberation"
Forester,KBB,"Car has a vibration in seats and floor, had 4 sets of tires, rims changed, new drive shaft, Axiel change out been with dealer over 30 days wait wait wait"
Forester,KBB,"Most dependable, great to drive."
Forester,KBB,"A wire burn-up under the driver seat, unsure why?"
Forester,KBB,"This car was purchased for the wife, she loves it. She'd like to buy another Forester but not many available to match this one. Looking for a 2021. She'd like the rea pwr. gate with her next purchase. I like the car also, it's a fun drive and has all the equip. needed for a 2nd get-around car. We have taken good care of this car and will miss it. It's just time to trade up."
Forester,KBB,It basically drives itself
Forester,KBB,Engine auto shut off is loud and gets annoying
Forester,KBB,"This is the first new car I‚Äôve ever owned, and with this model, it‚Äôs actually been a great investment. I love it so much, tho, I couldn‚Äôt imagine selling it."
Forester,KBB,Quality brand in every respect.
Forester,KBB,Interior could be a bit more plush.
Forester,KBB,"First, I‚Äôve owned eight Subarus! Why you ask? Reliability, dependability, safety, quality and fuel economy for a full time AWD vehicle. Having lived in WV most all my 67 years, I can attest to the capabilities Subaru puts into their cars. Come snow, rain and whatever else, Subaru comes through every single time. And my 2021 Forester Limited takes us wherever and back safely while sipping fuel at an average of 28-32 MPG! Fit and finish are exceptionally good and the cabin, while not super fancy, is quiet and comfortable. Subarus price point is very reasonable for their top of the line Forester. If you are looking for a vehicle that can do it all, I suggest you at least test drive one. You‚Äôll be surprised and hooked at the same time! Happy trails."
Forester,KBB,Top of the line with every safety feature
Forester,KBB,audio system
Forester,KBB,"2019 Subaru ForesterTouring - So many safety features, ""all wheel"" drive, fit and finish is top of the line, audio system is below par, value is better than almost any car on the market, white is the best color for the market."
Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane
+250 dollar donation to Make a Wish Foundation

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle."
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle.

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle."
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created."

Forester,KBB,Elegant and fun to drive.
Forester,KBB,I can‚Äôt think of any. I love this car.
Forester,KBB,"I am a loyal Subaru fan, and went from an Outback to a Forester.  Love this car because it is comfortable with plenty of room and stylish.  A plus is that it is a beast in the snow.  Love the softer seats and so easy to clean.  Wish Subaru would come out with a hybrid model for better gas mileage."
Forester,KBB,Saftey and Quality
Forester,KBB,Tire vibration(Brand?)
Forester,KBB,"This car is very 'features rich'.  I traded my 2017 in for more safety features, especially Rear Auto Braking, and braking in front.  The lane departure feature is good, but not necessary in all cases. 
The mileage per gallon is what I expected. Much better than my 2013 Kia Soul.  The vehicle has everything I need, and many other things.  I love it!!"
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable car, Touring model with top features, lightly driven during pandemic, in excellent condition."
Forester,KBB,"Comfortable, fuel economy, awd, reliability"
Forester,KBB,Some safety features were a bit confusing at first
Forester,KBB,"Very comfortable,  good fuel economy, great winter driver. Have owned both the Rav4 and CRV and the Forester has won me over. I looked at all 3 prior to my purchase, test drove, read research, etc on each before deciding. Coming from owning both Toyotas and Hondas, it was a leap of faith as I had great experiences with both. Looking back, glad I made the change. No regrets."
Forester,KBB,"So pretty, everyone comments on it. Love Subarus!"
Forester,KBB,There are no cons. It's comfortable driving long
Forester,KBB,Had to get larger car to enable disabled husband get in the vehicle.  He can't bend his legs to get in & out.
Forester,KBB,"AWD, driver assistance, infotainment"
Forester,KBB,Pricy
Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version."
Forester,KBB,Loaded with advanced features.
Forester,KBB,Radio is good. Gas economy far from advertised especially city driving. Outside features are very nice except the looks. Long and narrow. Not very stable on the road if compare to my Mazda CX-5.
Forester,KBB,Excellent visibility
Forester,KBB,Very weak engine
Forester,KBB,"I used to own Forester XT, with turbo engine, and I was happy with it. Subaru no longer offers that engine, and the standard one is downright anemic. It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads. We got stuck behind the slowest car on the road because the Forester would not accelerate quickly enough to pass on those short stretches where it is safe and legal. On the plus side, visibility from the cabin is excellent, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. Another problem, however. Many of the safety related driver-assist features are very poorly implemented, turning them into a nuisance rather than an asset. And many of those features cannot be permanently disabled."
Forester,KBB,Reliable
Forester,KBB,"Slow, noisy engine"
Forester,KBB,"This is my wife's primary vehicle.  I do not like the 4 cyl engine with CVT transmission.  It is ok once up to speed, but the 4 cyl, CVT combo is slower than a snail.  I also do not like the auto engine cutoff when you stop it traffic.  This feature can be bypassed, but you have to reset the engine cutoff every time you start the vehicle. As for reliability at 36,000 plus miles, we have had zero problems with it."
Forester,KBB,"Fun to drive, good gas mileage"
Forester,KBB,Some radio issues
Forester,KBB,"Bought this baby in December of 2020, 2019 Forester Sport. In January of 2021 we had a massive ice storm in Ohio and this thing did not slide at all. In February we had a snowy and windy night and driving down the freeway, the wind was trying to blow me out of my lane. The lane keep assist kept me centered and would not let me out of my lane. It was awesome! We drove this car from Ohio to Virginia Beach and back, loved it. I love this car so much and I can't imagine myself driving or wanting to drive anything other than a Subaru Forester. Great gas mileage, never have any issues other than a few radio issues here and there."
Forester,KBB,Gas mileage great easy getting in and out
Forester,KBB,"Cup holder location, auto shut off, viberation"
Forester,KBB,"Car has a vibration in seats and floor, had 4 sets of tires, rims changed, new drive shaft, Axiel change out been with dealer over 30 days wait wait wait"
Forester,KBB,"Most dependable, great to drive."
Forester,KBB,"A wire burn-up under the driver seat, unsure why?"
Forester,KBB,"This car was purchased for the wife, she loves it. She'd like to buy another Forester but not many available to match this one. Looking for a 2021. She'd like the rea pwr. gate with her next purchase. I like the car also, it's a fun drive and has all the equip. needed for a 2nd get-around car. We have taken good care of this car and will miss it. It's just time to trade up."
Forester,KBB,It basically drives itself
Forester,KBB,Engine auto shut off is loud and gets annoying
Forester,KBB,"This is the first new car I‚Äôve ever owned, and with this model, it‚Äôs actually been a great investment. I love it so much, tho, I couldn‚Äôt imagine selling it."
Forester,KBB,Quality brand in every respect.
Forester,KBB,Interior could be a bit more plush.
Forester,KBB,"First, I‚Äôve owned eight Subarus! Why you ask? Reliability, dependability, safety, quality and fuel economy for a full time AWD vehicle. Having lived in WV most all my 67 years, I can attest to the capabilities Subaru puts into their cars. Come snow, rain and whatever else, Subaru comes through every single time. And my 2021 Forester Limited takes us wherever and back safely while sipping fuel at an average of 28-32 MPG! Fit and finish are exceptionally good and the cabin, while not super fancy, is quiet and comfortable. Subarus price point is very reasonable for their top of the line Forester. If you are looking for a vehicle that can do it all, I suggest you at least test drive one. You‚Äôll be surprised and hooked at the same time! Happy trails."
Forester,KBB,Top of the line with every safety feature
Forester,KBB,audio system
Forester,KBB,"2019 Subaru ForesterTouring - So many safety features, ""all wheel"" drive, fit and finish is top of the line, audio system is below par, value is better than almost any car on the market, white is the best color for the market."
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
RAV4,KBB,"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!

RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
RAV4,KBB,"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
RAV4,KBB,NONE
RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

RAV4,KBB,Reliability
RAV4,KBB,not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"

Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."

RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!

RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride.

RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport.

I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."

RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!

RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride.

RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"

RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
RAV4,KBB,"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive!
RAV4,KBB,wheels/rims need a style upgrade
RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
RAV4,KBB,"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
RAV4,KBB,NONE
RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
RAV4,KBB,"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive!
RAV4,KBB,wheels/rims need a style upgrade
RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
RAV4,KBB,"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
RAV4,KBB,NONE
RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."

It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first."

RAV4,KBB,I get 99.9 MPG use no gas most of the time.
RAV4,KBB,Takes 4.5 hours to charge at 240 volts 15.6 amps
RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
RAV4,KBB,"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive!
RAV4,KBB,wheels/rims need a style upgrade
RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
RAV4,KBB,"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
RAV4,KBB,NONE
RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."

RAV4,KBB,"I've owned a lot of cars in my time but this is by far my favorite. It handles well, rides smooth, and is so quiet on the highway. Super comfortable--and the mileage can't be beat. Love my new Rav4 Hybrid!"
RAV4,KBB,Reliability
RAV4,KBB,not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
RAV4,KBB,"It‚Äôs a Toyota so it will last a long time with minimal problems. The car itself is comfortable and looks nice. The only downside is that the vehicle sounds at all times like multiple pieces are loose on the interior‚Ä¶ there are rattles in the cabin from every direction that cannot seem to be found or fixed. If noises bother you, this one will definitely be a deal breaker."
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem.

RAV4,KBB,"The Toyota Rav 4 is great for around town driving gets about 38 miles on a full charge
doing 65 MPH. I guess it would get 42 miles doing 55 MPH. On longer trips the RAV 4  Gets
35MPG doing 70 MPH. I guess it would get 40 MPG Doing 55 MPH. When the RAV 4 runs out of electric the motor automatically starts and take over you do not feel the difference except for some engine noise. The Rav 4 Runs smooth and has great power rated at 302 horsepower.
The engine can be a little noisy some times. It has plenty of cargo space in the rear and
seats 5 comfortably."
RAV4,KBB,This is the noisiest vehicule I have ever owned. Step on the gas to pass and Wow. Seems like the engine wants to rip out of the car. Other than that I like the car. But I much prefered  my 2018 Rav 4. Regret changing.
RAV4,KBB,Great gas mileage
RAV4,KBB,Not much
RAV4,KBB,"With the rise in gas prices I decided to trade the truck in and get something that would get substantially better gas mileage. (Not disappointed with this aspect.) Every fill-up has averaged about 39 miles to the gallon. I also bought a Toyota as it synonymous with reliability. Has 3 modes of driving. Sport, normal and eco... I like the feel of the sport mode. I was also amazed at 6'4"" that I can sit comfortably in the back seat. It is a very nicely laid out vehicle with lots of safety features and included options."
RAV4,KBB,"Sporty look ,quite, economy, comfort, power"
RAV4,KBB,"Head room is low , no remote start"
RAV4,KBB,"Great car . I've upgraded my 2016 rav 4 at 80.000 miles because my transmission switched- had no choice I bought only available car my dealer had and it was 2021 rav 4 hybrid. Completely different car then older one . Pleasure to drive, very comfortable seats , love my light gray interior ( much better then black in my 2016) car is so quiet so I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on and leave with out turning off. Power is as well great"
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive
RAV4,KBB,No cons
RAV4,KBB,Run smooth great on gas mileage and I love the style of  the car. It was great to have all wheel drive especially with all the snow we had this year and handles great in the rain. The backup camera is a plus and the cargo space is great you can fit a lot of things in there.
RAV4,KBB,Loved driving my car!!!
RAV4,KBB,I wish the engine ran a little quieter. I ha e to
RAV4,KBB,I have had my Toyota for 3 years now and I thoroughly enjoy driving it.  It has been a Winner in my book!
RAV4,KBB,Fun to drive!
RAV4,KBB,wheels/rims need a style upgrade
RAV4,KBB,"Love this vehicle, it's like driving a cloud.  Great visibility, smooth and responsive acceleration, great clearance, great gas mileage, plenty of cargo space, comfortable and quiet ride. Love the large touch screen/back up camera and the blind spot monitoring.  Very happy with this purchase."
RAV4,KBB,"Smooth ride, extremely economical, fun to drive,"
RAV4,KBB,NONE
RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person."
RAV4,KBB,"Great mpg, fun to drive, comfortable"
RAV4,KBB,"low tow capacity, lack of interior color choices"
RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too. We are RAV4 fans for life, especially after this new 2022 SE!"
RAV4,KBB,Great reliability and value.
RAV4,KBB,Seems to be made for short people.
RAV4,KBB,"Wanted the RAV4, tried several, no matter how seat is adjusted, top of my legs bump bottom of steering wheel.  Specs show 41"".  That's too short, needs to be at least 43"".  I'm 6' 1"" with slightly longer legs than torso, used to be champion long distance runner.  I can't get comfortable in this car, the cramped leg room will be terrible on long trips.  Thought about a bolt on seat extender but then my arms will probably be extended too far to be comfortable."
RAV4,KBB,"very quick and responsive 219 hp, roomy and quiet,comfortable, fun to drive
BONUS...COASTAL SOUTH CAROLINA DRIVING...CONSTANT 44.7 MILES PER GAL

RAV4,KBB,Space to small  millage  supost  is 46 charged really only 35 mill price sobre evaluate  and the tax deductible  is 7500  is nothing  is not real
RAV4,KBB,"I've owned a lot of cars in my time but this is by far my favorite. It handles well, rides smooth, and is so quiet on the highway. Super comfortable--and the mileage can't be beat. Love my new Rav4 Hybrid!"
RAV4,KBB,Reliability
RAV4,KBB,not stable side mirrors on high speed.. noisy
RAV4,KBB,"Buying a 2021 RAV-4 was one of my dreams as a Camry owner for 10 years.. and with whatever Camry offers i was led to believe RAV-4 would offer far more options.. decided to buy the XLE model knowing its the luxury model..!! but guess i was WRONG.
after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.
called dealer back and the reply was all these EXTRAs comes in packages for me to pay for which put me in shock till today. not happy at all."
RAV4,KBB,Great hybrid driving experience and fun to drive.
RAV4,KBB,Little bit underpowered for what it could be.
RAV4,KBB,"I traded my 2011 FJ cruiser for a brand new Rav4 Hybrid Limited. My first thought was, wow, I did not know how smart these cars had become! Overall fit and finish of car are very nice. My only complaint would be the aggressiveness of the torque in the engine. The vehicle is snappy, but not nearly as much as it could be. A bigger battery and more power would make this a sporty car. Still fun to drive, and I enjoy the creature comforts!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"(1/27/22 UPDATE: Living in the Northeast, we get all the wonderful elements. Safety features decided to disable themselves.  Took it down to Nissan, and the tech guy said that there is nothing they can do because Nissan developers are (his words) fucking morons for putting the sensors directly underneath the bumper. So when water, mud, snow hit it, it disables. So I said your telling me that I have safety features that are supposed to protect me and my family in the elements, but the elements prevent the safety features from working! And he said ""that is exactly what I am telling you"".) ORIGINAL POST: I have had my 2021 Nissan Rogue SV Premium Edition for 2 months now. More than half the time it has been in the shop. CVT issues strike again! 2300 miles and the SUV buckles when merging onto the highway, RPMs shoot up to 5-7 when the vehicle is at 15 mph preventing it to accelerate. If it wasn't for the quick instincts of the driver coming at me, I would have been in a horrific accident due to no acceleration coming out of a side street. This vehicle has been nothing but problematic since purchasing, which is really too bad."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Fell in love and traded in my 2017.  This is my third Rogue and after my 2017 i was convinced never again... but I did and now regret! A couple of months ago when it was extreme cold temperatures my 2021 wouldn‚Äôt start. Would turn over but engine wouldn‚Äôt engage... first time this happened thought it was my fault cause foot slipped off break while pressing the push button start.  Waited 15 min, attempted again and it started.   A couple weeks later, happened again.  Only parked for approximately an hour, this time my foot was firmly on brake and no start!   Tried to boost, waited it out and nothing.  With only 500 km , I decided to have towed back to dealership!  Unacceptable!!! Computer scans and error after error appeared.  Now the reports are with the Nissan engineering for review and conclusion for fix. The 2021 rogue has proven to have issues with start when temperatures is -15 C and colder!  The reading suggest replace computer but results are still under review.  I have issued complaint with NIssan Canada... still waiting for conclusion.   Very concerning cause I travel daily in rural communities and winter is 6 months long with daily normal temperatures of -15 for at least 3-4 months. Caution if you live in colder climates!!!  Want to give 5 star for the mere beautiful change inside and out, the ride is amazing but the starting issue drops the rating to only 2 stars:("
Rogue,Edmunds,"I just purchased a brand new rogue 7 days ago and yesterday I took it to the freeway to test the propilot and after 5 minutes the warning light was on and said CVT malfunction Service not available. I pulled off to a stop turned off the engine and restart again. The warning light was gone. I got back to the freeway again and turned the autopilot again and about 3 minutes warning light on again. I can't turned it off so had pulled over and stopped the engine and restart again this time the CVT malfunction light was gone but engine check light was on and can't turned it off. I called the dealer and dropped the car off for them to fix it. It was frustrated when you spent over $32k for a brand new car and only last for 120 miles and had to go to the shop. Never experience anything like this before on a new car. Very disappointed, should have gone for a different brand."
Rogue,Edmunds,Do not buy. 2021 Nissan Rogue 23 hours old and 170.0 miles suffered catastrophic engine failure. Worst part is that Nissan left my parents who are in their 80‚Äôs on the side of the freeway in the middle of nowhere and car can‚Äôt charge phone and it‚Äôs cold and raining with semi trucks passing them and hazard lights will not work. Nissan says we are sending a truck but we are going to leave you on the side of the road and you need to call Uber or negotiate with the tow company. Nissan‚Äôs response put their lives in danger for over 4 hours. My mom and dad are terrified of this car and Nissan‚Äôs response.... I will bet everything I own that Honda or Toyota‚Äôs response would have been way better and It‚Äôs not possible to be any worse...
Rogue,Edmunds,"According to my technician at Summerlin Nissan in Ft. Myers, FL...the possible malfunctions ""may be taken care of with the two recalls we have on your vehicle.""  My reply:  What recalls?

Antilock breaking software issues was the recall they have allegedly resolved.  After 5 hours of sitting in a waiting room.

Next issue:  Constantly being told I need an oil change.  Service light comes on with the little oil can.  Its so cute.  (Sarcasm).  Started when I first had 350 miles on the car.  Took it in.  It is properly set in the dashboard of the car, but there is something else malfunctioning causing this to again, malfunction.

Next issue:  Sonar Lane Change Blind Spot Detection shuts off at will.  No reason.  

Next Issue:  While sitting in the parking lot of a grocery store, every warning light came on in my car.  Tech told me to wipe off the sensor.  Um, which sensor and where is it located and why, after just over 1000 miles should I have to be doing this in the first place.

Called Nissan USA directly.  They told me a whole different story aside from what the service techs and manager told me.  They claim to have told them that I refused to leave the vehicle for service.  In a manner of speaking.  After waiting over 4 hours for what was supposed to have been an appointment, I had no more time and they had no loaner.  So, yes, I did refuse, but I have the text trail to prove the actual comments and the photos sent to the techs of all these screw ups.  Awaiting to hear from Nissan to see if they are going to buy this piece of tin back from me.  My first, and certainly my last, Nissan.

Top of the line....if this is as good as it gets, I feel sorry for Nissan."
Rogue,Edmunds,"My daughter bought this 2021 Nisson Rogue, piece of junk. It has 1900 miles on it and it is in the shop for the second time, should of been 3rd.  Imagine driving down the interstate, engine failure coming across the dash, the car pulling itself over to the side of the road and putting itself in park, scarey huh. And Nissan's solution, don't replace the car, oh no, it needs a module that they have no idea when it will be available and whether it will even fix the problem.  I drive a Toyota and would never even consider a Nisson, especially after this."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I recently upgraded my 2018 Rogue SV for a Rogue SV 2021. I love the new exterior design, and new safety technology. However, I failed to review the new Rogue SV features before I went to a dealership. The sales guy focused on showing me the new features and never mentioned what was taken away from the 2018 SV nor I asked for it. Now I am very disappointed that my 2018 SV had more convenient features than my 2021 SV and yet I paid more for the 2021 car. Rogue SV 2021 doesn't include:
 
Motion-Activated Liftgate -kick sensor
Power liftgate- Keyfob-opening & closing 
Blind spot sensor (alarm sound is very low)
power heated front seats
Divide-N-Hide and multi-level Cargo System
Power height-adjustable liftgate 

After this rip-off, I will think it twice before I lease another  car from Nissan again. They overpriced the New Rogue SV, and if you want the old standard SV features, you would have to go for the SL trim and of course pay at least $5000 or more than an SV."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Update!

Buyer beware. I‚Äôve had a draining battery that needed charging. AC very lacking for a new car. Leaking drain or roof racks. Rattling in car. Nothing can ever verified or fixed. Light always coming on saying I need an oil change. Which started at 12 miles. It‚Äôs been reset more times then I can count.  But the newest problem is which first happened June 3rd and again on July 13th engine malfunction reduced power. You can‚Äôt accelerate more then 40 mph. Being told the code is gone. Seriously anyone can clear a code. The code scanned by dealership as EGR. I‚Äôm finding out this is an issue from other blocks. I can‚Äôt recommend this car at all any longer. I‚Äôm afraid of the safety concerns to my family in this car. 

The Rouge Platinum has all the safety and comfort I was looking for. I love almost everything about the car. It‚Äôs a pleasure to drive. Only drawbacks is no ventilation in seats, no height adjustment in passenger seat, no auto up and down on passenger side.These are big deals.  I love the wireless charger and wireless Apple Car Play. Digital display is beautiful and crisp and can be customized on the platinum. I‚Äôve got many compliments on the car."
Rogue,Edmunds,I just bought this car and have had it for 32 days and the computer is making the service light come on. I just took it to the dealer and they said the entire computer needs to be changed and is why the check engine light keeps turning back on.
Rogue,Edmunds,From day 1 i have issues with this 2021 nissan rogue sv   I cnstantly get engine lite on the car dont start it says i need the key  the key is sitting next to start button also get locked in or out    Very dissapointed to say the least i have medical issues that keep me from walking or standing to much im actually afraid to take this car anywhere due to that and more dealership has been great i find nissan higher ups to be issue the car was looked at 10 times new battery put in at 400 miles car will not charge past 70 percent car was looked at last week by their higher up tech he coudnt duplicate issue of no start and lockiut so they are closing the case out >>>if i have anymore issues feel free to call hello the issues never stopped..such a waste of money I should have kept my tblazer..
Rogue,Edmunds,"I am with great disgust writing this review hoping that Nissan Canada finally does something about the defective Rogue 2021 cars.  Took a brand new Nissan out of the showroom and it malfunctioned . Called them they said bring it in and a part was ordered after 4 weeks. Took it in for inspection and replacement . I took it out again after 30 minutes while changing lanes my malfunction light went on . 
If I got into an accident while using the technology they sold me and persuaded me to get platinum , would they be responsible .
I don‚Äôt feel safe in this car , I‚Äôm paying through my nose for what piece of failed machinery . Nissan better recall the cars before something terrible happens. They just do blame game shifting responsibility between the dealership and other factors . Nissan horrible service , total disaster ,no responsibility , what kind of company is this . 
They have had multiple complaints and are still selling this dysfunctional car knowing malfunction can be hazardous to be on the road . Shame on you Nissan , entrapping  us in a lease and selling us such a car knowing it has issues abs then not recalling them nor replacing them nor cancelling our lease . 
I hope you read this and take some damn action !!!!!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Bought new 2021 Nissan Rogue SV in June 2021. Decision was based on the beautiful exterior/interior design, features available at an affordable price compared to the other brands. Within first two months, the infotainment touch screen stopped working multiple times and would start working again after the vehicle was restarted, loud noise from engine or transmission while driving on the freeway. After the vehicle was restarted that noise is now gone. I am now really skeptical as to what will go wrong next. I am loosing my confidence on the Rogue if it will serve as a reliable vehicle for my family."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Problem with the AC, the temperature cannot be controlled, it comes out hot from the driver's fans and I took it to the dealer and they told me that it was designed to work that way, which is normal, it drives me crazy. I've tried to get the problem solved but until now they say it's normal and bought a dozen new cars and it's the first time this has happened to me with a 42-mile car"
Rogue,Edmunds,right away it had transmission issues. Would not accelerate correctly at times. Happened at least five times in three months‚Ä¶ not sure why. The RPMs shoot up and the car won‚Äôt accelerate properly. Have to turn it off and back on again and then it works. Took it in for that and the recall on the reprogramming of the ABS (got that letter days after my purchase). They did a thorough check on the car and it also needed a new battery!!! Battery was low. What?!! 2021 was a redesign‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt buy Nissans when they do a redesign. Wait at least a year til they iron out the kinks.
Rogue,Edmunds,"I leased my 2021 Nissan Rogue AWD Premium package Feb 2, 2021 and I regret it. I have 800 miles on it, live in Ohio and the temperatures can get very cold. The remote starter is a piece of crap. It won't work until you get all the way up to vehicle. The Nissan Connect to start the vehicle isn't that great either.Thank goodness its a trial. I owned a 2018 Rouge, took it in two times out of the 31 months I owned it for issues. 

With this 2021 my first incident happened when we got extremely cold temps and snow a week of me owning. The window and windshield wipers iced up so bad I could barely see. When sitting at a light the engine will idle very high and when I pull off, you would think I'm drag racing. As my foot is on the gas pedal you can feel the vehicle decelerating instead of accelerating. A warning light had popped on and off quickly. When I took it to the dealer they asked me did a warning light come on? I said yes but it quickly went away. They seen an old code but nothing to document. Said it was low voltage light and that's probably why I feel the decelerating as its trying to pull power. Then preceded to say unfortunately Nissan's don't like the cold and not built for it. Are you kidding me!!! I've also owned a 2016 Altima and the 2018 Rogue and never had that issue.

The traction control (VDC)  is kicking on every time I go over this rail road track that's on a slight incline once I'm over it I can not accelerate because of the VDC. and it's happening when the weather is nice and the roads are not wet. This is a dangerous situation as other cars could be behind me trying to get over track before a train comes. The radio is giving me problems. As of today was playing music, received a phone call answered and the music would not play again. Could change stations, but not hear anything. After 4 minutes received another phone call, caller was very low after hanging up the music started playing again. This is my only means of transportation. This will be my last Nissan. These 3 years are going to be so long. Wish I could get out of it now. However, I don't have 15- 17K just sitting around to put with a another vehicle to eat up the negative equity.   

Update 10-8-21
Still having issues. You can feel every bump in the road. The dash on driver‚Äôs side started lifting. On the passenger side some of the panels is separating. When panoramic sunroof cover is open and you have the windows down you hear the cover flapping. 
Started hearing front end noise. The list is too long. Nice redesign. But I had enough that I was blessed to get out of it on yesterday."
Rogue,Edmunds,I had a 2018 Rogue for three years and never had to do any service to it besides oil. I just got my 2021. This is my 25 day having it and it again has to be serviced. First time my low engine malfunction came on and apparently there will be a recall for it soon. Now my remote start doesn't work and its -33 windchill right now.  Super disappointed since I loved my old rogue. Need some reliability.
Rogue,Edmunds,"We leased a 2018 SV Rouge.  The lease was up and went to Gerald Nissan in Naperville to see our long time sales consultant Howard Krick.  At first we were not interested in the new Rouge.  The 2018 was a bit sluggish and the CVT was loud and didn't have a punch.  I already lease a Murano and we were prepared to purchase one...Then Howard suggested my Wife drive the 2021 Rouge just to see.......WOW!  what an improvement.  From a quiet ride, to a higher stance, a good punch with the increased horse power.  The interior is top notch.  We leased the SL with the premium package....it has almost everything you need.  Check it out....it's worth a test drive.  If this is any indication of what the 2022 Pathfinder will be, then I may lease one of those, when my lease if up in November.  I have owned 7 Nissan's and these cars just get better and better....."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Complaint,  why didnt Nissan but a garage door opener on the rearview mirror? I bought a 2021 Nissan rogue sl, I had a 2018 sl that had it on ."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I have been car shopping for some time now,  I decided to check out the Rouge platinum and it was incredible! Quiet ride, panoramic roof plus all other bells and whistles.  It lacks power when accelerating, but it's a great family SUV!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"2021 Nissan Rogue SV is junk.  Has been in the shop 3x before even putting on 5,000 miles.  Recalls, air conditioner did not work and now waiting  to get a new radio and screen ordered as this stopped working too. This vehicle is a very rough ride and noisy. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  I contacted Nissan and was told there is nothing they can do!  They will not give me my money back or give me the value of the Rogue in trade.  I will be trading in for anything but a Nissan - at a huge loss!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Engine idles like a train, passenger seat shaking up due to bad idling, transmission rebuilt soon and snow enters air duct and will jammed pack the filter, your max speed becomes 10 miles an hour"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Our 2021 Rogue platinum is beautiful, comfortable to drive, and loaded with amazing features. The manual is an inch thick and it took us 2 weeks to get a basic understanding of the various gadgets.  With all these advanced digital features, wouldn't you think Nissan would have thought to include a built in garage door opener??? We have our 15 year old, clunky garage door opener attached to the nice and clean sun visor on the driver's side of our gorgeous new car.  What's up with that???  This car has everything - well almost. The 10 year old car we traded in for this new beauty had a built in garage door opener. Nissan what were you thinking?"
Rogue,Edmunds,Very comfortable. The Platinum is loaded. Lots of cargo space. Good mileage.
Rogue,Edmunds,I just made my first payment with 2600 miles. The chip engine light came on after 6 days. Service says they don‚Äôt have a fix yet. My remote start won‚Äôt work and my Nissan app says my rogue is running when it is parked beside my house. I‚Äôm looking at it right now. Run.. don‚Äôt walk!!!
Rogue,Edmunds,"CONS
Major:
#1 - I purchased the top of the line package out the door at $42K, and dont get a Homelink?  
#2 - The horn is LOW. Nobody can hear us.  Had to get this replaced.
#3 - The shifters have changed where its (R-N-D) instead of (D-N-R).  That's right, there are going to be accidents for sure.  I thought I could get used to this, but I pause and do a lot thinking before I move the vehicle since my wife and I share 2 vehicles with the shifters backward.

Definitely dont understand #1, #2 #3.  Engineers must have been drunk when they finalized this.  

Annoying
#4 You will feel the road.  Noisy.  I guess its a trade off if you want to get more MPG.
#5 Tires will skid in heavy rain at 50mph on highway.  We were on a 80mph highway, went 50, and started to skid.  Car didnt feel sturdy.  Had to reduce to 30 mph.  This is less performant than my Murano.  I will change the tires after a couple of years to top of the line.
#6 Very expensive!  We paid MSRP and the dealer squeezed us an extra 2K out of us for this stupid dealer package because new cars are in high demand due to chip shortage.  Looking back, we should have went to another dealer.  But at 42K, this is way over priced for what we are getting.  I will say the 0% financing did save us a little.
#7 Navigation is incorrect at times, even the MPH, which the adaptive cruise control is based on.  Sometimes the adaptive cruise goes too fast or accelerates too fast.  Not always accurate, have to pay attention.

PROS
- Saves a lot of gas, good for local work commute.
- Love the new electronics, heads up display, steering assist and all that jazz.  It is very nice.  I think every automaker top of the line will have these.
- Seats pull back when you turn off the engine, lets you get out easier.
- Safety features
- Size good enough for my family of 4.
- Even though twice as expensive as my last car, it was actually $300 a year to insure it.  Nice surprise! I guess insurance considers all the extra safety features.

WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN?
I dont know, but I would have most likely gotten the Mazda CX5 Signature."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I leased a 2021 Nissan Rogue SV and less than 24 hours after I drove it out of the dealership, a warning ‚ö†Ô∏è appeared ""Engin Malfunction, Reduced Power, Service Now"". Went to the dealership the next day and received BS answers one after the other. The warning has come up 7 timed in the 5 months I have had it and I have taken the car in twice now and left it so they can figure out why the warning comes on. The first time for 3 weeks and the second time for 7 weeks. To this day, they have no solution, they don't know why it happens yet they say the car is safe to drive and they release it back to me. The Willowdale Nissan Manager (Jino Park) and Salesperson (Roger Peng) ignored my emails. The Service department said there's nothing they can do and the customer satisfaction managers also care more about their own pockets than making customers happy. The issue is still not fixed and I have to continue paying for this car until the end of my lease in 3 years, which to me feels like I'm flushing my money down the toilet every month!!! Nissan doesn't care at all about customers and their car buying experience! This has been a nightmare and the worst car-buying experience I have ever had! Never Again!!! Buy anything but Nissan!!!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Do.not.buy.a.2021.Nissan.Rogue! I bought my Rogue last year and it‚Äôs been in the shop more times than I can count. I‚Äôve had engine issues, battery issues, passenger seat issues, multiple water leak issues and I only have 5k miles ( mostly because it‚Äôs always in the shop! ) I filed a complaint with Nissan and requested a buy back but was denied. While the service department that works on my vehicle is nice and helpful it‚Äôs just a crappy car and I regret purchasing it."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I am driving a 2018 Honda CR-V. Love it. However, it's my 2nd one. I drove a few different like vehicles and i must say other than the Mazda CX5, the Rogue was impressive. The interior in my opinion was the nicest of the bunch. Nissan did a great job. I thought it rode well and the engine power was adequate I personally felt it needed more power but for most people it is just fine. The interior makes you feel like you are in a much more expensive car. There are a few things about it that I absolutely did not like. The center console storage is a split opening like a clam shell. I hated that. I keep a lot of stuff in mine and this would drive me crazy. The opening is narrow and small making it hard to get your hand in there. The salesman said but you have a shelf underneath, well try to access that while you are driving, NOT HAPPENING. I personally do not like the side mirrors as they are angled in a funny position. These are minor things but I personally think that Nissan has a huge winner on their hands. The Rogue is one of the best looking compact SUV on the road today and i think the interior is nicer than the Mazda CX5. I think the Mazda handles the best and doesn't feel like an SUV drives like a sports car. I am probably alone in my thoughts but i do not like the Mazda knob to control the radio, HVAC and driver info center. ""IT'S DISTRACTING"" The Rogue has a ton of tech and is not annoying like the Mazda. That being said, I really like the Rogue until I got back in my 2018 Honda CR-V and drove it home. My Honda has a better ride and has better pickup on the highway. Also i like the fact that everything in my Honda is easy to see and I am not over whelmed by too many buttons and screens. But i am 63 years old and most people would consider me old but i am very tech savvy and for me, less is better inside a car. Too many distractions are a bad thing today when it comes to driving. If i did not have a Honda I probably would have bought the Rogue immediately. Great vehicle."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I am so pleased with my new car! Everything from the Interior, the performance & looks of this car gets a 10/10 from me. Definitely my favorite car i've ever owned so far. Thank you Steven Wilson from the Fontana Nissan dealership for helping me with my purchase, I couldn't be happier."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I have a platinum. The car is gorgeous and there are so many convenience & safety upgrades. However, 6 months after purchasing I noticed water damage on the ceiling. The passenger side pillar is leaking. It‚Äôs been in the shop for 6 weeks with no end in sight, as they can‚Äôt get the parts to repair it. I have read a Reddit thread and cars continue to leak after the ‚Äúrepair,‚Äù as they‚Äôre just replacing with the another shoddy part. This is the only affordable SUV I love and I am terribly disappointed. My 2017 rogue SL was wonderful."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Less than 500 miles and in the shop exactly half the time I have owned it.
Electrical issues. Shuts it's self down."
Rogue,Edmunds,"The seat is so uncomfortable. There is no proper lumbar support and all the support feels way low on the back, almost at hips. Starts to hurt my back in 15-20 minutes. I haven't had any back issues with any cars at all. No issues even with older rogues.

Every little bump or uneven road surface feels so loud and jerky. Really poor suspension. Air conditioning ducts don't work properly. One will blow hot air and others will blow cold air. 

Bought this for comfort but there is no comfort for me."
Rogue,Edmunds,"This is an initial review. We bought a Boulder grey pearl 21 SL. We‚Äôve had it for a week now. My wife loves this vehicle. It is very easy to drive, so easy, that if you turn on the pro pilot cruise it will literally drive itself. The shifter is different but only took a trip or two to get used to it.  The seats are very comfortable, it‚Äôs the most comfortable vehicle I have ever sat in. The tech is crazy good in this car and easy to understand. Nissan made it very user friendly. The features are amazing in the SL. The motion lift gate works perfectly. The storage space in the rear is comparable to our old Honda Element (with the rear seats removed) which is a huge positive. My wife does animal rescue and loves how easy it is to put cages and supplies in back. I took it grocery shopping and the divider system in rear was perfect for groceries, no sliding around issues. The rear seat is big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and our sales guy was 6‚Äô6. He was easily able to ride in the back seat behind me with plenty of knee room. The ride quality is smooth, very smooth. Like every Nissan, the engine is perky. One thing my wife loves about my 2011 Nissan Frontier is how much punch the engine has and this 4 banger Rogue doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Sport mode allows a little more punch from the engine and you can feel it in traffic. I have yet to have to refill the tank. So far, we‚Äôre averaging 34 mpg and that‚Äôs about 60% rural and 40% city driving, so impressive is a understatement. The vehicle has a massive panoramic sunroof so the interior feels huge compared to other SUVs. The information center on the car is big and easy to access. We have been using it with AppleCar play and it‚Äôs worked fine every time. The hands free options for texting or calling work great. The interior of the vehicle is not just functional, it‚Äôs a gorgeously detailed interior. Dual colors for the dash and door material. The wood grain accents really sell luxury and all the material seems very high quality especially compared to previous Nissans such as the old rogue or my old frontier. The road noise is low and I do not hear any whining from the CVT. The LED lights make a huge difference at night which my wife loves since we have to spend sometime avoiding deer and black bears on the roadways. Overall, this vehicle is exceptional."
Rogue,Edmunds,"We just bought this today and it was 2 hours home. In the city of Bangor Maine the roads are smooth so the ride is ok. As we got outside of Bangor this thing rides like a tank, you feel every single bump hard. There is no comfort mode on this car. The seat are terrible and to make it worse any bump on one side and the body roll on this thing is unreal. We won't be keeping this. It is too bad because it is a sharp vehicle but the hard ride and seats and body roll make this one to stay away from. Worst car we have ever bought,"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Had a corrupted file fry my anitlock brake software on the first oil change. At 15,000 miles my tires need replaced. Stay away from this vehicle. Nissan did compensate for the software issue but will not stand by the tires they are putting on new vehicles."
Rogue,Edmunds,Awesome car. Love the style. Spacious and comfortable.
Rogue,Edmunds,I love the new body style and interior of the 2021 Rogue. It was a great first impression to the car and only got better with the exceptionally smooth drive that followed. The safety driving features are amazing and the update technology works amazingly.  Purchasing the 2021 Nissan Rogue was the best decision that I could make.
Rogue,Edmunds,"Upgraded a 2018 Nissan Rogue to this 2021 Rogue; I‚Äôve owned this vehicle for almost 3 months now and as of now I‚Äôve sat in the waiting room for three and a half hours due to recalls and my engine light being on this fast week only foe it to be 3 days later and my engine light is on once again. Stopped at O‚ÄôReillys on the way home and was told after plugging it up that it is in fact on again due to the fuel rail. I‚Äôve never had this many issues, this vehicles came with lots of flaws"
Rogue,Edmunds,"I purchased my new 2021 Rogue from Walt Massey Nissan in Andalusia, Al. several months ago. Several weeks after buying it my wife and I traveled to another State via Interstate Highway to visit our son. We discovered that when you drive the vehicle over 45 mph, or a road with expansion joints the Sideview mirror on the drivers side vibrates so much you can't distinguish objects coming up behind and beside you. When we returned home I took the vehicle back to the selling dealer. The mechanic that serviced the Rogue reported that he ""even drove a Rogue out of the dealers inventory and it had the same situation so there is nothing wrong with it"". I called Nissan of North America and was told to take it to another Nissan dealer, a trip of over 100 miles from Andalusia. The reason I chose Walt Massey Nissan was to where I could have any service, if needed, done locally; I am now wondering if I chose the wrong make of vehicle or just the wrong dealer?"
Rogue,Edmunds,"To be honest, I hadn't thought much about the Rogue. I had the impression that it was lame, weak, boring and not very capable. After researching some competitors, I researched the Rogue to be thorough. It met my basic requirements - AWD, over 8"" ground clearance, at least decent gas mileage, good cargo space, creature comforts like Android Auto. It seemed worth looking at in person. When I test drove it, I was pleasantly surprised. It handled very well for a CUV. I really like the cabin design/layout. The seats are very comfy. It has tons of safety features. I hope it does as well in the snow as advertised!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"I have had the car a little less than a week. I've been around cars all my life. Right now we have an '18 Porsche 911 we use on weekends and a '21 Lexus RX350 my girlfriend drives. This car replaced a '19 Jeep Grand Cherokee as I wanted to downsize a little.
I considered the Subaru Outback, Volvo XC60 and looked at Hondas as well as another Grand Cherokee if all else fails. As most are aware, it is very difficult even finding inventory and then when you find a car in stock it never has the trim level you want.
Overall I am happy with the Rogue but the quality control at the Tennessee plant stinks. After bringing the Rogue home I noticed two things immediately. 
1) There is a gap with the rear hatch closed. Very uncommon to see issues like this today.
2) The passenger side front and rear doors were NEVER finished at the factory. It looks like a teenager in shop class for the first day finished them. The door skins came off the cutter and then wrap around the inside of the door top and bottom. On this car you can see where the metal came off the cutter and it looks like a piece of aluminum foil you cut from a roll. It is then supposed to be filled in and painted. It never was. The driver's side is fine. The passenger side just had some paint slapped on it. How does a car leave the plant with these glaring issues?
I hold the plant manager responsible and the QC team. Just shoddy workmanship. Period.
The car rides OK but it is a stiff ride with the 19"" wheels/tires. You will feel every imperfection in the road. And be aware of the tire pressure. 33 front, 30 rear.
Wind noise is noticeable even at lower speeds.
You have to go up to the Platinum model to get side sensors which we had on the Jeep. I did not want the Platinum model because I don't want ""quilted"" seats.
As noted by reviewers online the Bose sound system is really subpar. You hear the small left and right side pillar speakers and that's about it. It may well be the worst sound system I have heard in many years. And who puts a subwoofer next to the spare tire well and then covers it? Ridiculous.
Having only a few hundred miles on it I hope I don't run into some of the issues I have read here in the reviews. Subaru, Honda and others are using the CVT transmissions so one would think they are sorted out. 
One a positive note I will say that there is a nice paint job on it and with the exception of what I noted above the build quality is good. That may sound like an oxymoron but the defects are quite noticeable. It also does not have an AGM battery. If you have a car with Auto start/stop you have an AGM battery. I know. Jeep replaced THREE of them in a TWO year period. Not only are they expensive but they require a technician to calibrate everything when it's installed. About $235+ for the battery and $125+ for labor/calibration. Fair warning, DON""T get a car with the Auto Start/Stop if you plan on keeping it past the warranty period. Even if they cover the battery, they DON""T cover the calibration. 
The a/c takes a little while to get cold and the engine takes a little longer to come up to temp than I am accustomed to but both are livable. 
I have read the reviews here as well as owners' reviews on other brands. Every brand/model has their good and bad points. 
The bottom line is;
Would I get another Nissan? 
I will say I regret not waiting a few more months as Jeep and some other brands of interest are coming out with all new models."
Rogue,Edmunds,Engine is anemic even in sport mode. The sun roof is a joke. Hardly opens enough to do anything. Seats aren't that comfortable. The center console does not move so you can't get support under you're right arm if you need it. Cabin is quiet and feels sturdy. Definitely an improvement in cabin design and looks.
Rogue,Edmunds,"Bought 2021 rogue only in May 2021. With only less than 1k miles, my car started to experience acceleration problems where you can go any faster than 40mph while RPM shoots up to 5-7. I recorded 2 incidents and showed to Nissan but all they say they found no code! This is really a threat to our safety and Nissan keeps on ignoring the issues. They don‚Äôt give a damn"
Rogue,Edmunds,Well I haven‚Äôt purchased the rogue yet but I do test drive it ! My husband and I test drove a Kia Sorento it was nice . We are trying to really take time and make sure we get one that‚Äôs right for the family he has a new Chevy truck! So we decided to test a few out that rated well ! So we had to drive to Jamestown NY. Since there‚Äôs no Nissan dealer near us in Pennsylvania! There‚Äôs one in Hornel NY. But we decided to go to Jamestown those two were the closest. Well we loved the Rogue everything about it ! The looks and the feel . Room is spacious! I‚Äôm surprised the one guy wrote he was 6 ft 1 talk and 240 lbs and was cramped because I‚Äôve watched you tube videos on it and the one guy was 6 ft 1 or 2 and he said he was around 240 or 250 those were his words in the video he fit just fine with plenty of room he did adjust the steering wheel so it came out more ! But I know some people say it‚Äôs not speedy but I found it fun to me and my husband it‚Äôs beautiful that‚Äôs for sure and very solid ! I already have everything picked out for it once we test drive a few more ! To see  Honda we haven‚Äôt yet or Toyota  and Hyundai ! That will be it !! But I did look them all up and the Nissan looks so much better but my husband said I just can‚Äôt go by looks well I said you can by comfort cuz I honestly don‚Äôt know how the others are going to beat the rogue on that !!! A+++++!! Great job Nissan !
Rogue,Edmunds,"So far I'm super impressed with the vehicle.  Very comfortable inside and all the tech one can need.  That heads up display is fantastic! Enough engine power for most drivers. 
Only quirky thing I've noticed is the wireless phone charger.  My iPhone 12 Pro Max fits nicely but often takes a few times repositioning it to get it to connect and charge.  I've not tried a smaller phone yet but will.  
Overall I'm very happy and impressed with this Rogue!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Platinum trim is awesome.  Quiet, smooth ride.  Could not be happier.  Traded my 2015 Murano SL and I'd have to say the new Rogue seats are just as comfortable and the Rogue; Platinum has less road noise."
Rogue,Edmunds,The 4 cylinder engine is a loud irritating  constant humming or buzzing sound.  Even turning the radio up loud does not help.  Not an enjoyable experience.   I dread having to take it on a 9 hour road trip!
Rogue,Edmunds,Couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase.  Affordable and smooth ride.  Extremely spacious and will love driving to and from work in this.
Rogue,Edmunds,The Rouge Platinum edition has all the bells and whistles tech lover can have. Looks at all the editions and make the best decision for you.
Rogue,Edmunds,Absolutely love this car! I used to hate any car to longer than 3 hours. No more! Drives like a dream and fantastic gas mileage. Love the Bose sound system that came with the premium package  and the super comfortable leather seats. It‚Äôs got great pick up for a 4 cylinder and we are definitely happy with the purchase. I highly recommend!
Rogue,Edmunds,The reviews don‚Äôt lie. The new Rogue is exemplary. The ride and handling exceed that of the three letter German SUV. Gas mileage is over 30 MPG. QUIET too.
Rogue,Edmunds,"I have a 2021 nissan rogue sport s for approximately 10 months now. I am being flashed every where I go night and day because my DRL is constantly bright and even though they dim once the headlights turn on, it doesn't help matters since even on low beam the lights seem to be always so bright. I have been back to the dealer and I guess because I am a woman, I am being told there is nothing they can do without them even getting a technician to check. I am beyond frustrated. Feels like I have been  bamboozled!!!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Cruise hasn‚Äôt worked since day 1. Front panel goes black for 20-30 minutes before gradually returning to normal. Warning senors never work.
Lights won‚Äôt automatically go from brights to dim."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I had this car for a month already , it is very quiet and it feel luxurious,  save gas, BOSE audio is really good and the infotainment is good but it had crashed twice already ,probably  it will be solved with updates , overall I am very pleased üòÄwith car üöó."
Rogue,Edmunds,"We love our Nissan vehicles, this 2021 Rogue SL with Premium Package brings up to date.  Meine Frau and I were considering a second Murano then announced she wanted much better gas mileage, thus the ‚ÄúRogue Idea‚Äù was born.  Found our Rogue through Edmunds, went to Courtesy Nissan Tampa for ‚Äúa look‚Äù and transacted business.  Our salesman was tops in our book-Ben Walker.  Our Rogue is, being updated and completely transformed for the 2021 model year, is simply no longer the ‚Äúmouse-car‚Äù Rogue of old!  The 4 cylinders sirprised is with PLENTY of pep and acceleration.  I could go on and on, but will just say this:  the 2021 Rogue is an exceptional auto and buy.....per us, Nissan has hit a home run with this NEW Rogue. (Over the years....three Nissan trucks-2 being kingcabs, 1 Maxima, 1 Altima, 1 Murano)  Repeat after me: N i s s a n.  Good, you‚Äôve got it!  Smile."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Peppy with a nice ride.  Jam packed with tech, but not as much as the 2019 jeep Cherokee I traded in.  Actually the only thing I miss is the searchable owners manual that can be bought up on the screen.  I like the size, storage and kick to open tailgate.  The seats are comfortable and sidelines are not obstructed.  Very pleased with the vehicle. One exception.  The electric shifter is hard to get used to and probably dangerous.  To shift into reverse the shifter has to be gripped while depressing a button on the side. Easy.  Then to move in reverse the shifter to be moved forward.  If you operate it like any other  car in the world and move it backwards,  add some gas a d the vehicle will move forward.  Very hard to get used to.  Otherwise love the vehicle.  Think we got a good deal with the help of Edmunds pricing."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I rented a 2021 rogue for a trip and hated everything about it. It's very technological, but the tech doesn't work.
The screen reset every 5 minutes, which reset the clock, apps, reverse camera, and radio settings. 

The driving assistance made the car almost dangerous to drive- the laning assistance made it hard to change lanes, and collision detection system made it hard to pass slow vehicles.
The cruise control doesn't work without the collision detection- and the collision detection doesn't work when it rains or snows. So no cruise control, no radio, GPS, reverse camera.

This car was a rental- it was very highly maintained! Not even a year old and already the systems were breaking!
It's large, I guess. That's a plus."
Rogue,Edmunds,"When I first was given it as my Fleet vehicle I couldn't stop talking about.. I actually thought it was quite nice inside and out and rode really nice.

But now... its all leaks, CVT issues.. now a crazy rumbling in the back end like the AWD system is ever reactive. Dealer has had it for 23 days now as I get in and experience the same thing over and over. THANK GOD I personally didnt buy this and it is only a Fleet vehicle... but still a massive headache non stop having to take it in... and they haven't even began to look at all the leaks it has.. Sun roof, back gate.. A pillar. Thing leaks worse then my 1988 VW Cabriolet leaked."
Rogue,Edmunds,"This Nissan model is plagued with transmisssion problems, which are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit. 

I bought my 2021 Rogue in December 2020 and it has been in the shop 4 times since May 20211. When I climb the steep hill to my house and push the STOP button, the SUV makes a terrifying clunk of metal on metal and lunges forward! It doesn't normally do this on flat land, but will once in a while.

The Nissan dealer service center (I've been to 3 different ones) claim they don't see the problem--there's no problem if they can't recreate it, mind you. Well, all dealerships are on flat land, not a mountaintop! 

I've contacted Nissan Corporate about their supposed Buy Back Program and was told that I have 2 years left on my manufacturer's warranty and they are just sure it will be addressed in that timeframe. 

There are not many negative reviews for this SUV out there, but I suspect most owners don't drive a 30-degree incline 4x a day, so they may not experience the same problem. 

Though the interior is lovely, cabin technology is current, passenger and cargo space is generous, and handling is good, I still DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SUV BECAUSE OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. I suspect that if I kept it, I'll be sinking thousands into continuous trips to the service center---which will all result in ""we don't see a problem.""

I am trading it in today for a Lexus UX 250h and I pray it does not disappoint me like the Nissan Rogue has. I understand that the Nissan Path Finder has the same transmission with similar problems."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Lots of gizmos, safety features. Comfortable ride. Slow, but not dangerously so. Good steering feel. Brakes are good. So far no glitches or dependability issues.  If you're old enough to have experienced the old GM cars you might remember how good the A/C was in those cars.  Well, I'm currently driving in 90+ Florida weather and I'm constantly having to turn down the air to prevent frostbite.  A real meat locker, in a good sense. The windows are tinted and well insulated, which helps."
Rogue,Edmunds,"After two years with my 2019 Rouge SV, I decided it was time to step it up in terms of interior quality and performance, I've been a fan of Nissan's for awhile now and when I purchased my 19 it was disappointing that Nissan rehashed the same design yet again, however with the new Rouge it's got a love it or hate it personality to it. My review will be talking about the Platinum version. In my opinion, I REALLY wish Nissan offered a better engine for this year. It's got more power and more ""umph!) then the previous year.. but I think they could have thrown in an engine that delivered my HP and more torque to the wheels, however with that said.. I'd gladly that what they offered anyday vs. the previous model. 

Interior quality is great, the wireless charger pad I wish was bigger. Nissan forgets that there are phones larger than 6.7 inches now, a bigger pad would have been appreciated. The dash is excellent. It's perfect, it's OLED display and since I'm a tech nerd, I love it. It's bright, clear and the heads up display is.. okay. It's a nice feature to have. After a software update wireless apple carplay was offered which is great and has just a hare of lag when switching songs. 

However, looking at the reviews I'd say the SV with tech package (or whatever) is the best way to go, but if you'd want to go all out the top of the line, here is what we got from Nissan is great, you won't be upset with your purchase. ."
Rogue,Edmunds,Love it perfect for everything size rides great has all safety features
Rogue,Edmunds,"Lease end of 2018 Nissan Rogue SV with 3 years of no problems at all, great suv. Leased a 2021 Rogue Platinum. Beautiful & has 99% of safety & luxury options as our 2019 Lexus GX460 for a lot less. Very happy with another Nissan Rogue and the dealership we deal with :)?"
Rogue,Edmunds,"I read all of these reviews before purchasing vehicle.   I purchased a Rogue SL AWD.  I am pleased with the vehicle the only dislikes are a glitchy Apple play only works part of time with Bluetooth connect, but always works when plugged in.  The other Dislike is the front camera cuts in and out when parking vehicle in garage. My favorite part of the Rogue is the styling, the SUV looks great.  Despite my dislikes I would recommend the car as it is a great value compared to the other top rated Compact SUV."
Rogue,Edmunds,"I have the 2021 AWD SL model.  Great handling & comfortable vehicle.  The backup camera is especially nice with all-around view...I hardly ever have to turn my head to see what's behind or around me.  Many, many safety features & convenience options...wonderful! Large trunk area...especially when you put the back seats down.  A/C works great & quickly.  I have the Champagne Silver metallic color...great for hiding dust/dirt & looks classy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like that you have to have the remote so close by to automatically operate the doors.  And the vehicle sits a little high for an average to short person or someone with back issues... but you can program the driver seat to lower upon exiting...so that helps.  I had also considered the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, or a Subaru.  Glad I went with this one.  I bought it in March 2021 & still love it now in Dec 2021."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Just got the 2021 rogue sv (traded in my 18 sv). Dealer went over all the new NIFTY  features but never highlighted the removal of some important features of the 18.

This includes, 

Power tailgate
Heated seats
Separated back cargo

I'm also not happy with the location of the ac vents mainly the middle ones.  The bottom lip of the screen blocks the top of the vents and I feel like portion of the air bounces off and is lost"
Rogue,Edmunds,"The SV AWD has changed on some of the options. If you want heated seats, roof rails, and a cargo cover, you have to get the SV premium package now. I dislike how they made the cargo floor base with a solid mat cover instead of the dual base divided cover with  a hidden storage space underneath. I don‚Äôt care for the chocolate brown dashboard and door trim, especially on a gunmetal gray car. I still love the Nissan Rogue SV AWD but miss the extras that I had before."
Rogue,Edmunds,I love how it rides...beautiful inside with full sunroof..I dont like the shifter putting into neutral...I have problems with it..
Rogue,Edmunds,Great exterior look and sleek design. The all leather interior makes it feel like a luxury SUV without the price tag attached.
Rogue,Edmunds,"Let me Start by saying this is our third rogue. I have owned a Nissan Rogue through practically each iteration and I must say I‚Äôm overall very impressed by the improvement this vehicle has made over my 2015. The material quality, technology and just overall look of this vehicle is a significant step forward over the last generation. Our last rogue was traded with just over 100,000 miles and minus basic wear and tear it was a great all around suv. Only complaint I have is I wish they still had the hybrid option available."
Rogue,Edmunds,It has a lot of space and it has a lot of features. it has a power moonroof and panoramic moonroof for the front and back. The moonroof is standard on the SV model and up. i own the SL AWD and it is really good. It has a lot of space especially with the seats folded down and it has smooth braking and a soft ride. it is really good with bumpy roads and I would highly recommend this car. it is a really nice car for the compact SUV market.
Rogue,Edmunds,"We love the new design line of this SUV, it is a vehicle that represents its value, at the same time robust as a large truck, with a lot of comforts, I just hope it will be efficient in service and quality over the years."
Rogue,Edmunds,"We just a bought our 2021 rogue SV at MSRP $30,800 from a local dealership and currently have 3k miles on it and love it! It gets excellent mpg's and has a lot of tech that you cannot find from the competition at this price point. We hope to have it for a very long time as it's been a great addition to our growing family. It is a Nissan so it should be very reliable if you keep up on the maintenance."
Rogue,Edmunds,I went across country in a 2021 rogue sv. Very enjoyable riding . Panaramic sunroof was great for mountain areas . Never saw problem with power but only carrying  luggage of clothing for me and wife .üëç
Rogue,Edmunds,This SUV has it all. Leather Heated Seats and Stirring Wheel. Bose Ten Speaker Audio System. Full Moon Roof. Cameras all around the Car. Power Liftgate. Sirius XM Radio. The 40/60 Back Seats fold down easily. 19‚Äù Wheels.
Rogue,Edmunds,"Great Small SVU, Except for Climate Control.  It is now back for the third time to Napleton Nissan for Heat / Cooling problems.  At first good, then only super hot unless set to lowest setting (Lo) First time nothing done because they could not duplicate problem.  Second time they saw it on super hot both sides all the time.  The said Nissan first requires them to reprogram the computer controller. (why not do that the first time?) Still problems with at 70 degree swing in air temp out of drivers vent on a 45 minute trip to dealer (had photos of car setting and thermometer digital read out that I showed them.)The car was putting out 52 degree air at the dealer when set at 68 when I turned it over to them.  Again they cannot duplicate..  My pictures time and date stamped from that day did NO GOOD.  My first and LAST Nissan"
Rogue,Edmunds,"I bought a 21 Nissan Rogue Platinum a couple months ago and I have been satisfied with my car, it has what I was looking for."
Rogue,Edmunds,My 2021 Nissan rouge gets stuck in gear and the rpms shoot up to 5-7 thousand rpm. Nissan says they there is nothing wrong. I had a bottom end knock a few days before which they said was normal operation. Very disappointed as this car is only 2 months old and only has 900km on it
Rogue,Edmunds,This is my first car and I am really happy to have it. It's smart and look fantastic with my favourite Orange color ‚ù§Ô∏è
Rogue,Edmunds,New CVT not working.Service engine notifications. POORLY DONE INSTALLATION OF INTERRIOR LIGHTS.
Rogue,Edmunds,The radio is not a great option but overall nice little car if you looking for a small compact suv
Rogue,Edmunds,"I bought 2021 Nissan Rogue SV premium
The car doesnt even have 13 thousand km on it I had check engine lite come on. Brought it to the dealership they said 2 days later I need brand new engine no car for 12 weeks!"
Rogue,Edmunds,"I took one for a test drive.  I own a 2016 Rogue SV and was excited to drive the new one.  Handling, ride, road noise were all big improvements.  The downside was I felt way more cramped than in my 2016 Rogue.  I'm 6'1 and 240 and I just wouldn't feel comfortable.  The cargo space seemed about the same, maybe smaller.  I wouldn't purchase due to the new model being slightly smaller."
Rogue,Edmunds,Perfect vehicle for our needs.
Rogue,Edmunds,"The 2WD SV is my company car... It does everything this kind of vehicle should do. Before this I had a 2014 Ford Escape Titanium which I owned.  Here is how it compares to the escape:

Tech features:
It's not fair to compared a 2014 to a 2021 model, and I'm sure Ford offers some of this in the new Escape, but here is what I like about the Rouge: 
Pro pilot assist- I dig it.  It allows me to devote some of the attention I would have paid to making sure I was centered in my lane and watching the break lights of the vehicle in front of me to looking further up the road to plan which lane I need to be in to get to my exit or avoid slow-downs.  

The 360 degree camera-  I like it.  Very helpful for parking.

Android Auto- most Auto manufacturer Nav systems suck anyway.  All I really want is to have my Google maps from my phone on a bigger screen where I can see it without looking down at my phone, Great!

The stereo- Not as good as the premium system in the Escape, but unless you're a bass-head there's no reason one can't enjoy listening to music on the road with this system.

Interior: It feels kind of fancy. its got a lot of stitching and leather-ish looking surfaces. on the dash and doors. The Cloth upholstery feels soft and durable at the same time, and looks good. 
The cargo space seems more usable than the Escape.  I have an easier time loading bikes and other large objects in the Rouge than in the escape. I don't know if it has more cargo space or it's just the shape.

Driving:  Both the Rouge and the Escape handle admirably well for a Crossover, they're pretty much equal as far as handling goes. My Escape had a 2.0 liter turbo charged engine, but I test drove the 1.6.  Both accelerated better than the Rouge.  The 2.0 Escape had a lot more power. The 1.6 was similar in terms of horse power, but felt a lot faster due to the torque band of the turbo charger and the transmission.  The Rouge just isn't good in terms of power, and the way the CVT delivers it.  The paddles they put on the steering column so I can pretend to shift like a big boy are just an insult to my intelligence, don't placate me like a child Nissan!
The Rouge is efficient for it's size, but I suspect they could have greatly improved the driving experience  by offering a smaller engine with a Turbo and an 8 or 10 speed automatic transmission with only marginal impact on MPG. 

Conclusion: It's a nice, comfortable car that is easy to drive & live with.  I think where they chose to save money to undercut the competition on price was to neglect the power-train... probably not a bad business decision because most of their target market will never push hard enough on the gas pedal on the way to soccer practice or the grocery store to notice the difference. Personally, I like it for a work vehicle someone else is paying for, but if it were my own money, I wouldn't by a CVT unless it were attached to a hybrid power-train like in the Ford Maverick or Subaru Crosstreck to really save some gas, Either that or if you prefer power, a regular transmission with a turbo-charged engine.  All this CVT for efficiency nonsense is a lazy half measure."
Rogue,Edmunds,Feels great to drive!
Rogue,Edmunds,Be ready to get one when u go
Rogue,Edmunds,"The car is technology advanced but an absolute nightmare to drive.
Steering issues pulling vague feel just vile.
The car gives me no sense that the security and driver safety components even work been almost hit backing out of a parking space yet has rear traffic alerts and sensors.
Nissan refuses to do anything so filed a BBB complaint.
Should have got a Bronco Sport guys."
Rogue,Edmunds,"Great car
Our second Rogue"
Rogue,Edmunds,Love every aspect of it.
Rogue,Edmunds,front windshield washer SUCKS who ever came up with this ideal is an idiot
Rogue,Edmunds,Price appropriately
Rogue,Edmunds,"You think with all the extras in my new 2021 premium they would have a better factory command start. Mine never works every now and then it might. And you can never tell if it does start because the key fob doesn‚Äôt beep or anything. Even when I stand beside the vehicle it won‚Äôt start unless it feels like it. As for the starter app. That is faulty too. App tells you door is locked, but vehicle doesn‚Äôt start because I don‚Äôt get a notification until after I go out and physically start the vehicle. Then! I get the notification. And no it is not cold outside! My 2014 Equinox starts great with its cheap and on command start package. By the way I work in AUTOBODY"
Rogue,Edmunds,"Great ride, great on gas, second rogue and love it"
Rogue,Edmunds,I like this SUV. It will take a while for me to get used to bells and whistles of this vehicle.
Rogue,Edmunds,Truly enjoying my new Rogue!
Rogue,Edmunds,This Rogue is peppy and comfortable riding!
Rogue,Edmunds,I‚Äôve always wanted an SUV and my Nissan Rogue did not disappoint. I got the premium package and I love everything about it.
Rogue,Edmunds,This car is riddles with issues. Check engine light constantly comes on during cold weather. Had a few instance where the car decelerating when trying to accelerate and merging into traffic. Very dangerous and feel frustrated since it‚Äôs a brand new car. Will try to get Lemon law and get rid of it ASAP!
Rogue,Edmunds,"I bought my 2021 Nissan Rogue in December of 2021, it is now April 2022. It drives nice an has decent road manners however, acceleration is poor unless the vehicle is in sport mode. When driving down the highway in sport mode it has difficulty finding a gear that it‚Äôs happy which and the RPMs shoot up between 5000 & 7000 and just maintains there until you shift back to normal drive mode. Fuel economy is great much better than my previous Armada, I average about 28mpg (I have a lead foot). Interior quality for the SV trim with premium package is really nice and has great looking materials and finishes, the only complaint with the interior is the shift knob. I can shift the knob just fine but the Park button on top is already fading. I understand as things age they fade and discolor but the car is only 4 months old. Wish the vehicle had wireless apple car play and android auto, seems dated to have to plug the phone in. I consider this vehicle to be tough, it currently has almost 7000 miles on it and haven‚Äôt had any issue other than the above stated transmission/acceleration issues. I once ran over top of a deer doing 75 mph when the car beside me hit it and flung it in my lane. No exterior damage or undercarriage damage was noted when taken to the dealership, alignment was still spot on and no check engine lights came on."
Equinox,Edmunds,I bought a 2021 Chevy Equinox LT and after bringing it home and driving at a higher speed than the test drive I noticed an annoying  wind noise coming from the driver and passenger side. I thought the windows were not rolled up all the way and hit the button and windows were up as far as they would go. Noise still there. Took it back to the dealer and they checked door alignment and adjusted it as per specs. Noise is still there. They said it was coming from the rearview mirrors and nothing they could do about that. Is anyone else having this problem and what can be done about it.
Equinox,Edmunds,"bought a 2021 Equinox and I must say I am impressed. I thought a 4 cylinder turbo would lack the power BUT I WAS WRONG. Bought the LS with cov. package and it is JUST what we need in a vehicle. LOTS of room, great appearance, handles like a sports car at a price that IMPRESSED me!."
Equinox,Edmunds,Car handled well looked nice engine had pep brakes were good But I did not buy this car because the drivers seat was pure misery it was so uncomfortable that after 10 minutes I ended up with a back ache ...Number one thing in a car for comfort is the seat this seat was narrow and hard and cheap Im 6'3 inches 180 pounds tall and thin no one could be much thinner than me could not find any comfort no matter how I adjusted the power seat I love the car would have payed CASH for it on the spot but the cheep miserable drivers seat put a wrench in the sale I dont know how people wider than me can even drive this car
Equinox,Edmunds,My barely 3000k miles 2021 equinox is already misfiring when first start. Also it shakes from the back suspension after 75 mph. This is sad considering is a brand new car. Besides that it offers decent amount of tech for the price. Lucky for me this is only a lease. I won‚Äôt finance this.
Equinox,Edmunds,"Size ,ride,accesories are all perfect for my needs- luvin my Equinox"
Equinox,Edmunds,the 2021 equinox LT has lots of nice features and convenient also its comfortable sets and rides smooth and has very good power and SUV is very stylish too
Equinox,Edmunds,I rented a 2021 Equinox for a week.  Was pleasantly surprized it did everything well. The 4 cyl engine had me fooled it was a V6 until I opened the hood - its got V6 levels of quietness & smoothness.  The ride was as smooth & quiet as a Malibu or Camry - much smoother & quieter than several Toyota Rav4's I have rented.  The transmission was silky smooth (unlike the jerky Rav4). The vehicle tracked straight on the highway.  The AC was cold.  Cannot think of any faults other than the seat bottom could use more padding and the fuel economy is 4 MPG worse than the Rav4
Equinox,Edmunds,"The car does not feel as roomy as the older models but not uncomfortable.
 The ride is fine.  The car needs a redesign to give it a more pleasing look.  It looks like you are driving a cheaper car.  I wish I had purchased the Premier. It is a little difficult to enter and/or exit for a senior."
Equinox,Edmunds,Great SUV. not too small and not too big.
Equinox,Edmunds,"The engine runs rough on start up like it has a missfire or vacuum leak. The transmission doesn‚Äôt shift correctly.  The dealer says nothing is wrong. It drives like all the other cars they have. Now the car shakes like it has loose wheels.  I don‚Äôt know if the axles aren‚Äôt spinning at the same speed. I don‚Äôt want to take it in again for this new problem, because they don‚Äôt fix anything.  Just another day wasted at the garage and more of my valuable time I can‚Äôt get back.  I bought a new car so I wouldn‚Äôt be at the garage."
Equinox,Edmunds,Great car comfortable and inexpensive has everything you need a new more.  Cajun Red is beautiful.  Gas mileage is superb.  Can‚Äôt miss on the Equinox Premiere with AWD
Equinox,Edmunds,I‚Äôm writhing this review hoping someone with the same issue isn‚Äôt stressing/ struggling like me . My brand new equinox with under 900 miles on it will  randomly wobbling / shake  in the front end while driving ! After a few seconds  it goes back to being a prefect normal smooth ride . The Dealership and GM have no idea what‚Äôs going on with it and are finally trying to diagnose it again ! I really wanted to love this car but I feel like it‚Äôs a major safety issue .
Equinox,Edmunds,"Had a 2015 and now my 2021, love the performance of the Equinox and the looks of it, I have plenty of room"
Equinox,Edmunds,It drives like a Cadalac... super happy
Equinox,Edmunds,"I'm impressed with the Great Options that comes with my new SUV. Heated seats for winter on my breaks and lunch, auto dim headlightsgreat for traveling on back roads, stability on curves and hills, Crash alarts when vehicles in blind spots and stay on the road to avoid a ditch. I switched from a mini van to The Equinox great choice."
Equinox,Edmunds,"Purchased this vehicle this past spring. Has been 25 years since our last NEW car, (still have the '96 Blazer) All the upgrades, safety features, and all the modern electronic features took us some time to figure out but we're getting there. The power of the turbo 4 cyl.really knocked me off my feet, it takes off like a 747. So far, love the car."
Equinox,Edmunds,"I like my Equinox but do miss some of the accessories my Cadillac SRX had, like heated steering wheel and a CD player."
Equinox,Edmunds,Great color selections!!
Equinox,Edmunds,"Wondering what is causing diamond shaped patterns on my windows , it showed up out of no where . Read my manual cover yo cover . Wondering"
Equinox,Edmunds,"Every 2 years the equinox is exchanged for a new one since it is a company car. 2021 has the most brutally uncountable seats, forcing your back to arch and presses your shoulders forward. Additionally the traction control on the base model is worse than any car I have been in within the last 10 years, other people have had similar experiences and have worn through 60,000 mile premium tires in less than 15,000 miles (believed to be from changing power from tire to tire) this used to be a great vehicle and Chevy has really messed it up, please fix this vehicle."
Equinox,Edmunds,The overall ride and handling is very nice
Equinox,Edmunds,"Car looks great, great controls, great standard features.  Can't say enough good about the vehicle.  Until you sit in and drive it.  All the good things about this car goes out the windows when you sit in the drivers seat and ride in it.  I physically am in pain after driving it.  I don't know what it is about the front seats they are incredibly unfordable.  I don't know how the designers of this vehicle missed something so PAINFULLY obvious.  If you like in northern climates I would recommend getting a AWD version.  As nimble as it is on dry and wet pavement it gets really squirrely when there is snow on the road."
Escape,Edmunds,"Personally like interior trim, smooth ride, and many extra features in the Titanium Hybrid.  Added a hitch for small towing needs, installed by Ford.  Factory installed would have been ideal but wasn‚Äôt in stock at time of purchase.  I am particularly impressed with mileage.  So far approx 43% of my overall miles are electric, however mostly short haul trips.  No regrets!  Very happy so far but time will tell how it holds up."
Escape,Edmunds,"Our 2021 Escape Hybrid/Titanium if fabulous- 51 MPG in the first 10 mile trip driving home from the dealer and I have pictures to prove it!  We have been getting 40-45MPG with mid-range gas in our driving over the past several weeks. The Hybrid drive and CVT make it very smooth starting and stopping which is very important for a family member who has had extensive neck and back issues and the battery pack shifts the center of gravity back toward the rear wheels making the hybrid much more nimble than the fully gas powered Escape. It's AWD and navigates the narrow, poorly maintained mountain road to our home with no issues.  Power is more than adequate on the highway. We are very happy with this vehicle."
Escape,Edmunds,"Considered the Honda CRV but chose the redesigned Escape titanium version instead.  Liked the stronger 250 hp engine and its traditional transmission versus CVT in the Honda.  The tech features (nav, HUD, app, safety) are significantly newer and at 6' tall I seemed to have a bit more leg room in the cockpit.  I also really liked the panoramic sunroof option and a bit more comfortable seats.  The car seems significantly more refined than the older generation CRV to me and the color and wheel choices appealed more to me.  I love the antimatter blue.  Negatives:  In higher trim levels the Ford appears at least 10% more expensive than the Honda (apples to apples) and it's historical resale value is poorer as well.  The Ford's interior is also not real impressive, seat materials even at the highest trim level (titanium elite) are cheap and hard plastics abound.  Most upper level configurations end with a black interior, no grays are offered. It's unfortunate you have to order the highest trim level to get digital gauges, LED lights and an electronically dimming rear view mirror; they are not offered individually.  Ford links interior choice to wheel selection which is also annoying.   All  in all I am happy with my choice (so far) and pleased to be driving an American car for the first time in 30 years."
Escape,Edmunds,"Love this suv, very easy to drive and love all the upgrades! Saving money on gas as well! My sis bought the same suv, we both agree loving the Ford Escape! My son has an older model and loves it as well! The price was right with the help of edmunds advise."
Escape,Edmunds,"The vehicle is ok.  I wanted to buy an economy SUV, and buy American.  I was really disappointed when my headlights fogged up in 7 months due to the supposed air flow and Ford said that it is normal and they won‚Äôt replace them.  My new car now looks years old.  Very disappointed with Ford customer service and learned a valuable lesson.  Don‚Äôt buy this car."
Escape,Edmunds,"I picked up a brand new Ford Escape 2021 on 4/26/21.  Two weeks after I picked it up, the check engine light came on and I could no longer drive the car in reverse.  I could go forward if I wanted to, but silly me, I thought I was going to have a car that could do both.  Took it to the dealership, but by the time they saw the car, the check engine light went out and it could go in reverse so they could not fix what they could not see.  Today once again the check engine light came on and once again, the car would not go in reverse.  Another trip to the dealer and a wasted five hours (getting a ride home took up the majority of that time) of my time before they determined that a part needed to be over-nighted.  So here I sit at home waiting for an overnight part delivery.  I do not have a vehicle to get to work tomorrow and who knows when I will have transportation again.  I do, however, have a really nice lease payment to make, so there is that.  Don't buy a Ford because getting in touch with them to file a complaint is not easy.  Thank God this is a two year lease.  I will find another brand the next time to lease."
Escape,Edmunds,"Car bought brand new in September 2020. In April I brought car into dealer because rear shocks were  leaking , drivers door broke, brake issues and auto hatchback had hit me in the head while loading car . I just got this car back two weeks ago . Hatchback and brake issue not resolved . When you spend 40000 thousand on a car do don‚Äôt expect to have these kind of issues as well as not having the car for 6 months .Dealership dropping the ball many times adding to the frustration along be unable to reach any executives in the corporate office"
Escape,Edmunds,"After trading in my lease early with my 2019 Ford Edge, which we loved the 2021 Escape is horrible. 
 
I hear a significant flapping and thumping noise that sounds like it comes mostly from the right rear wheel area and to a slightly lesser degree across the entire rear of the vehicle. It is a concussion type of noise and I don‚Äôt hear it when the windows are down. It does not record well, but passengers tell me it is more prominent when they are in the back seat area than when in the from seat. It is more noticeable on smooth roads as bumps and rough pavement is loud enough to mask the flapping.
The dealership reported a loose screw on the front was replaced, but the noise did not abate. I have crawled underneath and do not see anything loose, but the material the wheel wells are made of is extremely pliable and is not attached to anything structural on the back side of the tire. The rear bumper is also very flexible and has nothing rigid to attach to on the lower part of the bumper. I can flex and fold these materials easily and when ‚Äúthumbed‚Äù they make a similar flappy type noise as I hear while driving at speeds over 45 and under 65.
Going in for the second time at Greico Ford in DelRay Beach to try and get rid of this annoying sound."
Escape,Edmunds,Getting great gas mileage and love all the safety features....the insurance company does as well!!
Escape,Edmunds,"Gets great gas mileage, for me it averages 42+ mpg. Love all the features and options. Has plenty of room and is comfortable."
Escape,Edmunds,"The Ford Escape is the only car I will buy! It is safe, stylish and has everything I want in a car"
Escape,Edmunds,"This is my fifth Escape. I have loved all of them for their reliability, good looks, and low maintenance. My new one is a 2021 Escape Titanium Hybrid. I‚Äôll admit to being a little scared of all the bells and whistles, but it‚Äôs a great drive and is so beautiful!  Highly recommend."
Escape,Edmunds,"i bought a 2021 SE hybrid we are retired and its the best suv we have ever owned. we get 42 mpg. all the tec you will ever want, plenty of room, great design, very nice ride and drive.  with gas going up everyday it will save us big big time. everyone needs one of these. it also has a 5 star safety rating. in town or out in the country it feels like home."
Escape,Edmunds,Everything I could want from a luxury to a everyday car
Escape,Edmunds,"car is not much,  problems"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"2 days off the lot, torque converter locks up.  Takes a month for Ford to decide what to do.  Another 22 days for the transmission to be replaced.  Engine does not sound the same. there is a light rattle and some oil or fluid may be leaking from the engine/transmission area.  In an independant shop today. About two months out now."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I‚Äôve had my Bronco Sport for a little over a month and the AC compressor already has gone out. Ford said there‚Äôs no parts in stock and I have to wait months until they are available. On top of that, they said there‚Äôs no loaner cars available. I paid over MSRP with extended full comprehensive warranty and this is what happens.

I would think twice before buying this car. Extremely disappointed."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Bronco sport looks great and is fun to drive, when it is running.
We have 2400miles on a 2021 First Edition ad the engine failed.
It has been in the shop(about 2 months) at the dealer longer than it has been in the garage at my house.
Take my advice and wait a couple of years until they get the bus worked out"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Picked up Bronco Sport First Edition in May.  Currently at 4700 miles after completing a 3000 mile road trip.  Bronco performed wonderfully during the road trip, which included driving through down pour.  During an errand,  my wife was unable to start the Bronco warning lights flashing and alerts being generated and the parking light was flashing on the shift knob.  The Bronco started after holding down the start button for over a minute and after the system cycled through the error messages.  Bronco has been with at the dealership for over five days.  Dealer thinks possible electrical problem but still researching.  Contacted Ford customer support to log problem ticket for some sort of compensation."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"36k  price.  Loved this car up until I hit 2400 miles or less.  Noticed when I backed up and turned out of my drive way;  I heard a loud rough grinding noise last Thursday. I took it in the following morning to Ford they backed up two times but heard nothing and tried to send me away.   I insisted on them checking it out again.  Left it overnight and they still don‚Äôt know what is going on with it.  Not too happy with the Bronco Big Bend now.   Have an escape that is  not making the noise when I back up and turn out of my driveway. 
Anyone experiencing this??"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Had  power train malfunction warning lights going off as I was driving it off the lot. Warning lights go off every-time I drive it. Was in shop 3 weeks of the 1 month I owned it. Ford refusing buyback . I tell anyone & everyone I know not to buy a Bronco because Ford doesn‚Äôt back their cars.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"So far I‚Äôm loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It‚Äôs a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I‚Äôm not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven‚Äôt seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I‚Äôm not crazy about, it is the ‚ÄúAuto-Stop‚Äù function that shuts down the car at lights. I‚Äôm really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven‚Äôt used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I‚Äôve mostly stayed in ‚Äústandard‚Äù mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I‚Äôm not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles. 

Absolutely in love with it so far!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I absolutely love my Ford Bronco Sport.  I've had it for six months now and have replaced the windshield THREE TIMES!!! Any little pebble that could be a chip is actually a crack that runs pretty much across the glass.  This is definitely an issue that Ford needs to address.  I've spoken with my service advisor and he had nothing to say.  This should be a recall.  I cannot keep claiming poor quality windshields to be repaired by my insurance.  RECALL THESE WINDSHIELDS!
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I bought the Big Bend model in June, and within a few days, the information display went blank. It came back on, but it has gone off and on for a month. I finally got an appointment to take it in last Friday after waiting 3 weeks. The service dept. had it from 8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., and they couldn't replicate the issue. I gave them pictures of the blank screen from several different dates. I brought it back home. This morning, Monday, I started it up, and the information display was blank. I drove it straight to Ford and kept it running until the tech came out, plugged his computer into the car, and said ""the computer"" wasn't showing any problems. He said they will have to contact Ford to see what they want to do about it. Boo Hiss...I gave up my 2015 Ford Fusion that had next to zero problems during the 6 years I drove it for issues within days of purchase.

UPDATE 9/4/2021: They replaced the instrument panel, and I've had no issues with it so far for the last month or so."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I bought my Bronco Sport Outer Bank mid September 2021 and I love it.  I traded in my 2019 Ranger XLT and the Bronco Sport is a better size vehicle for me plus it is more fun to drive the Bronco Sport.  I have had many compliments on the looks of my Bronco Sport which is white with the black top.  I was a little concerned that a 3 cylinder engine at 181 HP wouldn't have much power but I was definitely wrong.  It has plenty of power.  The seats are comforable and the ride is very good for a short wheel based SUV.  On a recent trip of 2,500 miles including city miles, I got 28.8 MPG.  I was driving 75 MPH on the highway so I was quite pleased with the mileage and that trip was done with the ""Normal"" setting, not ""Economy"".  I do have two small complaints, the engine will rattle a little on idle and the visors are a little too big.  If I put them down in the front, quite a bit of my view is blocked from the road.  Ford needs to put a smaller visor in the Bronco Sport."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Have had the bronco sport for 4 months. The WIFI stopped working had to reboot entire computer system. Front fender mud flaps have both fallen off, bluetooth cuts in and out constantly, back window leaks water into the car every time it rains or go through car wash, tons of rocks are stuck in my rubber trim due to design flaw on car. Dont buy until they get it right. To top if off they want me to leave my car for a day or two and will not give me a replacement"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Just had the opportunity to drive the Badland edition, and I really liked it. I immediately dismissed it previously as a rebadged Escape, but I was surprised. Firstly, very good driving experience. The engine has good power, the steering has good feedback and great on-center feel, and it's refined. It felt really solid, and I was not expecting that at all. On the highway, I caught myself going over the speed limit many times due to its refinement. Comfortable interior, and really powerful heating/heated seats. I just really loved how solid it felt going down the road. The AWD system is really good! Turning off the stability control, it was really easy to get rotation in the snow.  I had to drive it to the airport during a snow storm, and it felt so stable on the highway!!! The headlights are really good! Really, I wasn't expecting to like it so much since I drove a new Escape and it felt really different. I liked the stiff ride, as it imparted a solid feel to the vehicle. The driving position is great, and it looks great in person. Like a mini LR Defender. The sculpted hood is really cool to look at when driving. Lastly, I loved the size of it. Truly maneuverable and agile. In terms of downsides, the 2.0T seemed to really eat gas. Probably because of the aerodynamics and the good performance. Also, the speakers were truly mediocre. There was a very obvious rattle under heavy bass. Overall, I'd really recommend it. It's priced higher than other subcompact SUVs, but it truly feels more expensive due to its solidity, good performance, and solid driving dynamics. I'm a fan!

Edit: The transmission calibration was significantly better than in the Escape. That was one of my biggest qualms I had with the Escape. In the Bronco Sport, it felt pretty well tuned."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Bought the Bronco Sport and within a week I noticed some strange creaks and rattles. Long story short, had to have the entire transmission replaced and while the noises became more subtle/quieter they still existed. The windshield glass also started to crack. You‚Äôll read on the forums about owner transmission problems along with the windshield glass being fragile. Bronco Sports are made in Mexico which is notorious for having quality issues. These vehicles are all looks and cheap short cuts underneath. I can‚Äôt see these vehicles having long term viability and no regrets about selling mine. Compared to its competitors, the BS build quality is really quite poor."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I purchased my vehicle April 2021 with approximate 50 miles so brand new. When driving it vibrates sporadically. When I reverse in the morning it makes this loud hard noise which was scary at first. I tried to schedule an appointment they didnt have any and could not provide a loaner car. I‚Äôm at 5800 miles tried to make appointment through the app during the month of September there is no availability. I‚Äôm just going to go in tomorrow and hope to have some luck.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Be aware! My moonroof/sunroof shattered/ exploded and came off my frame while driving, the scariest thing ever, I had to have the car towed to dealership. They just all seemed baffled and said they‚Äôd do everything go get it fixed Bc the car is 4 months old. The dealership/ford has no answers for me, other than waiting on a service rep to make a decision on my car/life/livelihood that I‚Äôm paying on and not driving, how does that make any sense?! It‚Äôs been weeks, I‚Äôm beyond devastated having this happen to a brand new car. I will not EVER be buying a ford"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I have the Badlands model that comes with the 2.0 liter engine.  I average 26.8 mpg at 4700 miles with highway mileage 29-33 (driving the speed limit.)  The interior seating is comfortable on long trips.  The back seats have limited space but are functional.  It has plenty of storage in the back which expands when the back seats are put down.  I have had no issues at all and just completed my first oil change.  The Badlands comes with a front facing camera that I use when parking to ensure I am where I need to be.  The front camera comes on automatically when engaging Rock Crawl, Mud/Ruts, or Sand mode.  It comes with Ford Co-Pilot 360 and Automatic High Beams which is very nice-automatically going to high beam and switching back with oncoming traffic.  The Co-Pilot 360 takes a bit to get used to if you have never used it before with the lane assist/centering, blind spot alerts, and pre-collision assist but it is very nice and provides for additional safety.  I have been very pleased with the performance of the vehicle and have zero regrets purchasing it.  As you read other reviews, remember all vehicles can have problems-the warranty addresses those.  Drive it yourself, see if it fits your needs, and if you purchase it-enjoy!  There are several Bronco Sport forums that assist with questions, problems, and a lot of ideas for personalizing it.  One year update-almost 10K miles and still running strong with no issues. MPG is about the same - average 26.6 overall since purchase.  Very impressed the the quality of the BS.  I have driven off-road several times and it did well. Buy or order with confidence!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I‚Äôve had my Big Bend edition and simply LOVE it. Ford really nailed the perfect mix of fun, utility, and super fun feel good vibe. Even though mine has the smaller engine it has plenty of power and pickup. Everywhere I go people stop and admire it. It has an excellent driving height so you can see the road great. Admittedly, if I‚Äôm ever on the sand it‚Äôs because I got lost, but having so many GOAT modes is a nice touch."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Blue tooth and sync is not good mine keeps going out on turning off in middle of using it no matter what Mobile device I use.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"As nice as it looks I only got to enjoy mine for 27 days, mine was rear ended and was totaled. The thing is my car with two others were at a complete stop when car #3 got rear ended the bronco barely got tapped and the impact bar crumpled. There is zero durability to the Ford bronco and when Ford is asked questions about it they ignore the consumer. Beyond disappointed."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,7998 miles on a 2021 big bend Branco and stuck transmission will not shift rotates shift knob by itself from drive to park stranded on vacation.  Other than that has no power and weird to drive
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,If you want to turn your back on the boring everyday SUV‚Äôs that all look the same then the Bronco is for you. I traded in an Acura RDX for my Bronco because it was uninspiring. The RDX was an excellent vehicle but looked like all the others. I feel safe in the Bronco which is something I haven‚Äôt felt since I owned a Toyota FJ Cruiser. I finally feel like driving again for no reason other than to take my Bronco out. The only thing I miss about the RDX was the memory seats.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I have had my vehicle for 3 months. So far the main screen behind the steering wheel goes completely blank. Unable to show mph etc. However after turning on and off several times it does eventually come back. Also I was just driving down the road and the rear glass window exploded. I thought someone may have thrown something at it but no one was around. Very scary! I have been advised of a recall as well with the gas line which I inquired about and a Ford Dealership said to come back they have not been provided the part to fix it with yet. üòîüòî
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I traded in my Mercedes for this sleek, safe and very cool small SUV. Feels like luxury vehicle on the inside and the ride is extremely smooth. Very well thought out details for the price!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I owned the big bend for 4 months and just traded it in for a Subaru Forester. The front seats are not comfortable, no leg room on the back seat, lacy of cargo space, ride is noisy, inside is cheap plastic, hood rattles while driving, lack of power and smoothness, auto stop feature is anything but convenient and for the price (34k) it was bit worth it in my opinion which is why I ended up trading it in."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"As I said, at first I was afraid to drive it, but now I am making excuses to take it on the road.  It is so fun to drive!  People look at the car and really do not know what to think.  Broncos have not been on the road for years, and now they are, and are better than ever!!!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Driving it for 7 months in Northern Michigan.  Summer was great but regular sized bike will not fit inside with inside rack.Bright lights are great but dims do not shine out very far and deer are a serious issue!  At 55 you are slamming the brakes by the time deer, or amything, comes into view.  Winter:  handles well in the snow and ice.  The wheel wells get completely filled with ice and difficult to remove.  Tires constantly rub on the buildup. The  cavity that hides the wipers fills up with ice and snow and freezes rendering the wipers useless unless you stop and try to remove all the ice and snow from around them which I'd difficult.  Great southern car or one kept in a garage."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I enjoy driving my Bronco Sport! Have owned 8 months and driven over 7,000 miles. Was concerned about the 1.5 engine but it hasn't disappointed with easy highway ramp acceleration and passing on two lane highway. Also handling is great with flat cornering and a tight turn radius. View out windshield is great. Headlights are best I have ever head for visibility on dark country roads and bad weather. Cargo area easily handled my load of bagged mulch this summer and the large box a new power washer came in. I  rarely have passengers in the back seats, so the one drawback of lack of foot room especially when entering or exiting back seat isn't a huge problem for me personally. Zero squeaks or rattles but there is some wind noise at higher speeds and a hard rain hitting the roof makes some noise."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I kniow I'm one of the first to driving a Big Bend Bronco and it's awesome!  The looks are Sweet! My surfboards fit in the back both outside the liftup glass or inside after folding down the seats if needed! Lots of head room and places to store things. Can't believe it's mine!
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I love the looks.  I love the size.  I love the exterior and the interior.    I previously had two Ford Escapes and knew the Escape platform was the basis for the Bronco Sport.   BUT...I should have examined the bronco more closely, and if you're thinks of buying one, so should you.  The driver's seat is too low, even at its maximum.  And worse....I would even say dangerous...the gas pedal is further away , and much smaller, than the break pedal.  So if you practice heel/ toe driving, you will find that if you position your heel so as to use the brake, only your toes will reach the gas.  In fact, your foot can easily slide off the gas pedal altogether, and could conceivably slip UNDER.  And conversely, if you position your foot to rest properly and effectively on the gas pedal, you may have to lift your leg or slide your foot back to apply the brake.  This seems like an accident waiting to happen."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Good looking vehicles. Comes with a  lot of standard equipment. Very stylish, smooth ride, power when needed, comfortable. Over all it is one of the  best vehicles we have ever had. Truly worth the price."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Love my Bronco. Drives nice, rides nice too! Handles great and the new color Area 51 is the eye candy of the year!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Wow I bought about a month ago 2021 Broncos sport big bend.ford you get a plus for this vehicle . its more than I could imagine! I must say great looks love color catcus grey,love all the features that come with it ,lot of room inside handles great,good on gas and gets you where you want to go.   Ford what took you so long to bring it back.q"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I have 8500 miles on my big bend and so far so good! I‚Äôve been off road around the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson and the White mountains in northern Arizona and my Bronco handled like a champ! If I can complain about anything, it would be that the bronco sport could sit a little higher. I am putting a lift kit and off road tires on it next month and can‚Äôt wait to get my bronco sport dirty again!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Very comfortable vehicle.  I purchased an Outerbanks model and absolutely love my Bronco. I'm learning about all it's interior features at present time. I love the look of this vehicle. Very,  very comfortable ride. I can't wait to take my friends on a day trip to Hill Country here in TX."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Took delivery in April......driven 8500 miles in it.......comfy quiet........easy to drive........does everything well........mpg since purchase......33.7...combined.......no mechanical issues so far.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Everyone‚Äôs needs are different and for me, Bronco Sport Outer Banks is excellent ‚Äúdog mom‚Äù little SUV. It also helped that my experiences with George Coleman Ford in Travelers Rest, SC made it particularly stress-free (I haven‚Äôt bought a brand new car from a dealership in many years, so I was leery). It‚Äôs nice interacting with people that don‚Äôt use high-pressure tactics and that honor their words (thanks Chase and Gerald!). I‚Äôm still discovering little ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù everyday that I didn‚Äôt realize I wanted or needed (like auto sensing on/off of high beams). The temps are cooling quickly and I live in the country, so things like remote start and remembering your climate settings (heated seats, steering wheel) all really nice in the morning for doggie day care drop-off.  My Bronco handles my 1/4 mile gravel driveway (obscured with leaves in some sections) with ease - happily takes on mountain roads and switchbacks with ease. The one ‚Äúwish‚Äù is that I still haven‚Äôt figured out how to save some of my preferred defaults (likely user error - definitely not a show stopper). Enjoy!"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Great vehicle, rides like a little truck.  The whole family really like riding in it.  It's loaded and comfortable to ride I both on and off the road."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Trans shudder at lower speeds after 2000 miles. Ford replaced torque converter and valve body. Trans shifted better and no shudder. 500 miles after repair shudder is back and transmission sounds like a loose chain at times. I hope they replace the complete transmission as I don't want to go through this a third time.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Bought a ford Broncos sport big bend. Soon as I saw the big bend Broncos feel in love with it.love the color caucus grey,love the style looks power and room inside and great gas miles."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"It‚Äôs a great little car. It can off road but don‚Äôt buy it if you think it‚Äôs bad ass. It‚Äôs not. Snow, ice, some mud and sand that‚Äôs not to deep are all within it‚Äôs capabilities.

The big bend has good safety features and for the price it‚Äôs a fun little guy"
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Fun to drive - in town, on the freeway or the back roads.  Really a nice vehicle."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,It's a 5 person SUV built for camping.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,They are hard to find right now.  Expect not to get much of of the sticker price right now.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I love it, it is so fun to drive and comfortable."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Omg the best vehicle i have Ever Owned...so excited
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Only had it one day too soon to tail loving it so far
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,A spunky 4wd that rides like a car‚ù§Ô∏è
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,For the money great deal
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,What else can I say? :)
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,Great ride beautiful color! Love the moon roof and wheels!
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Loved the vehicle, but the sound system was disappointing, there was no dual climate control, and luxury finishes were lacking."
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I really this car but i would‚Äôve perfected a few more luxuries like ventilated seats wireless apple car play.
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,The 2021 Bronco Sport (Outerbanks model) is such a great vehicle.  I love it. I drove a sedan for about 12 years and would never go back to driving a Sedan. This SUV has a smooth ride and is very quite. I'm able to get in and out of vehicle quite easily.  It sits tall people. I can even wear a hat while driving! I love my Baby Bronco!
Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"My brand new bronco sport started making knocking whirring noises immediately. Stopped going into drive and ended up stranded in a busy intersection. Ford says it‚Äôs the transmission and will be 2 months in the shop by the time parts even get here, longer than I‚Äôve had it. Extremely disappointed with this buying experience, be aware."
CR-V,Edmunds,"This is my second CR-V (still have my 07 which is still going strong with  175k miles:)
I love everything about the 2021. Drives like a bigger car in a good way, substantial and safe. The interior is lovely. Luxury feel without Luxury price.
Also, regarding all the reviews that complain about confusing infotainment system, if I can figure it out (without the manual) ANYONE can.
Love my Sonic Gray Pearl CR-V"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Awesome space. Brought the car for the spacious cargo and got it around for 28325 for EX trim. Guys, nowadays dealers are giving a good price. Please check with another dealer to get the price. Initially, I was hesitant to get this car. Now I am happy with the price they offered. Drove 3000 miles and super cool"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Ive had this car for 3 mths. bought brand new. Drives great, but the paint is terrible. Thin and soft. So far Ive had like 5 rock chips and there are some scratches from the unknown. I did not get paint protection on this car because other cars Ive had in thr past never needed such thing. Cars made today should be painted better."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Boy, do I love this car. It feels like it sometimes is driving itself with the lane assist. I love the seat warmers. I love the sound system. I love that I can take a turn and it grips the road. I love that it is so smooth driving and going over bumps. I love that I can put my GPS from my phone on it's more than ample big screen. Did I say-... I LOVE MY HONDA CRV!!"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Chose this car over similar ones in this class as drove the nicest.  Is quiet, adequate power, 
The bad, headlights not so bright, seat feels like a park bench."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Purchased a new 2021 CRV in August.  We have only put about 3,000 miles on it and went to start it the other day and it wouldn't start.  The whole dash started flashing with all kinds of failures.  We checked the battery, fully charged.  Had to call for a tow.  The Honda dealership couldn't start it either.  The codes were U0100 F-can malfunction and U0038 IMA Can Malfunction.  They don't know why and said it's an intermittent issue that could happen again.  My Honda warranty does nothing for me since they couldn't locate exactly what was causing the two codes to appear.  They wiggled wires, cleared the codes and did a battery reset but found nothing else wrong. I specifically bought a Honda because of I thought they were supposed to be high quality and a car I could rely on.  Now I'm scared to drive it as who knows when the intermittent issue will happen again. Is it going to fail while I'm driving?  I've lost all trust in my brand new car and prefer to drive my 14 year old Toyota instead.  $33k for a lemon, buyer beware."
CR-V,Edmunds,The CRV EX-L has great pickup and an amazingly comfortable ride. It‚Äôs very spacious and you can‚Äôt beat the mpg.
CR-V,Edmunds,"I totally hate the auto start/ stop feature. You should be able to disable it from the ""SETUP"" program and/or adjust the delay for the engine shut down. Main reason I hate it is that it is my wife's car and is typically driven on very short trips around town. Typically she goes thru 6 start cycles in under 5 miles., 3-4 times a week. The battery never recovers above 12.25 volts .  .  .  which is a 70% charge state. YES . .I know there is a disable button you can push every time you start out. BUT . . .it is very poor engineering to have to do that. I am looking at a battery maintainer to save having to replace a $200. battery in the near future."
CR-V,Edmunds,743 miles on it . Merge on interstate and lose power and dash goes crazy with system failure messages . Talk about fearing getting killed before can get off road!!
CR-V,Edmunds,"We just got the 2021 CRV Touring on a beautiful Sonic Gray color. We've had CRVs since 2002 and this latest model has a great feel on the road, no road noise which used to be an issue and the Touring comes with all the bells and whistles. Also the cargo space still is excellent, the turbo renting is very responsive, we will see how fuel efficient is but we expect it will be very good."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I test drove several similar classed SUV's.  I have had two Kia Soul's so good comfort and great audio were creature comforts I would not go without.  I wanted something bigger, safer, and AWD.  

The CR-V EX trim for me give me the seating comfort, great audio, safety features, AWD, and fuel economy I was looking for.  I shopped, I test drove everything in the same class.  Check the warranty offerings and options (I got some awesome rubber all weather CR-V floor matts that are much better than the plastic Weather Tech's I bought for my Kia) - there were other options I didn't even know about before I sat down to buy the car so I passed because I hadn't planned for them.

Solid smooth ride with none of the noise or underpowered engines on some of the other makes.  Plan on keeping this one for a long time."
CR-V,Edmunds,Purchased 28 days ago and AC has already gone out. Of course dealer can‚Äôt get part and it will be two weeks to get it fixed. Trading it in as soon as I can. Infotainment glitches already as well. Very disappointing.
CR-V,Edmunds,Purchased new and really could be better. Infotainment is awful and slow. Really not happy with this in this day and age. Hondalink is really useless in this vehicle and can't do nothing with this app. Can't even start car with app--come on honda! Engine has been fine and get great gas mileage and performance. I guess Honda thinks it will be fine without modern refinements. This just might be my last honda if electronics are not upgraded.
CR-V,Edmunds,I have had my CRV for a little over two weeks and love the gas mileage and ample room.  It is fun to drive and the love the extra safety features.
CR-V,Edmunds,Honda CR-V is a comfortable solid car that drives great. I would recommend the CR-V to anyone looking to buy a good reliable family car.
CR-V,Edmunds,"This is the third CRV I have owned.  I traded my 2013 for a 2021, after almost 170k in trouble-free miles.  I wish it wrere possible to get have gotten a brand new version of the 2013 rather than this overcomputerized, over plasticized car.  Too much plastic.  While handwashing, I could not put too much pressure on plastic bumpers, worried loosen them up, further.  Build quality not nearly as solid as the earlier model.  Despite all that, hoping for same reliability, at least mechanically."
CR-V,Edmunds,The engine is roo noisy. It sounds like driving 10year old car every time you press gas. Not many people mention this. Very disappointed. Over rated for sure.
CR-V,Edmunds,"Title says it all. I purchase the vehicle brand new (2021) three weeks ago, and have had it towed once and serviced twice. First the battery was already dead, then the infotainment system would no longer work. It‚Äôs okay looking, smells nice, and handles decently but I can already tell this was a poor purchase. Buy something else."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Well we just ordered our 2nd Honda CR-V touring.  Both my wife and I have so much good to say about this suv!  We took advantage of high used car pricing and ordered another new 1      Trust me on this , the Crv is 1 of the very best    Handles great , very comfortable , looks awesom for a suv !   And was trouble free.   I. Hope the next 1 is the same.  New 1 will be black pearl on black should be awesom.    John"
CR-V,Edmunds,Great comfortable car. Has all the bells and whistles. Great gas mileage. I certainly hope the electronics survive. I hope Honda has fixed the oil dilution issue.
CR-V,Edmunds,"The CRV feels like a small car, not an SUV. The engine is loud and the transmission is pretty rough when you are stepping on the peddle and accelerating quickly. We.were very surprised how poorly this car handles in the snow. The biggest issues we have had are with the interior and the overall technology. First this vehicle is not able to utilize the Honda app for remote start, or to lock the vehicle. The Honda app is actually a pay subscription service. The screen and controls also look grainy and like they have not been updated in many years. The screen feels and looks antiquated. The number one issue is the incredibly intrusive dashboard that comes to a point between the front seats. Storage is not convenient and the front seat is not comfortable for tall riders. Overall the CR-V is just OK. It looks good from the outside, but it really feels like it needs some updates on the interior and technology. It is a great vehicle for your grandmother."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I bought the Honda CRV AWD upgraded trim 7 months ago and have 2300 miles on it.
I've brought this car to two dealerships for help. I hate my CRV because of the way it shifts from braking to gas. When I take my foot off the brake as in at a stoplight, it makes a heavy clunking shift feel and sometimes lurches. To drive the car, one should feel nothing between the shifting of brake to gas pedal. The dealerships say it's a normal feel because of the auto engine idle. I think is either a flaw of the car, or I've got a lemon. I wanted this roomy vehicle to carry bikes and passengers. Also, the heated leather seats barely heat up. The service department head at one dealership said that it's normal for the bottom part of the seat to be cooler than the back."
CR-V,Edmunds,"5,000 miles in and I HATE this car.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  It is underpowered, uncomfortable, gets poor MPG (I drive all highway miles and am averaging 26 MPG) for the size and performance, the heat is non-existent, it has a lot of road noise, the outdated infotainment system is very clunky and often doesn't work, the AWD is not as good as other systems out there, the center console/storage leaves much to be desired.  Worst of all, I went to start it this morning and nothing.  The car is 2 months old and left me stranded.  My wife drives a 2015 Pilot and we love that car.  This is a total disappointment.  I would not recommend this car to anyone.  Get a Toyota or a Subaru and be happy.  This is last Honda I will ever own.  If I could convince the dealer to take this back, I would get rid of it in a heat beat.  Shame on you Honda."
CR-V,Edmunds,The XM/FM/AM radio tuning is terrible.  You have to Search  ...  the tuning knob I had on my 2018 Accord was great ... this 2021 CR-V.  Tailgate latch in intermittent ... alarms when exiting the car when nothing is wrong.  Never again... I'm going  to something else next time
CR-V,Edmunds,Fast and zippy plus luxurious comfort of a ride!
CR-V,Edmunds,"Car has automatic headlights and automatic high beams, I work at night lights up the road great. High beams go on and off at the right time.  The big taillights are important since a lot of people cannot see at night as you pass them by. Only $30 to fill up compare to $40 for my other SUV. Plenty of power at 40 mph before you know it.  I had a 2000 CRV lasted 19 years.  Just lost my 2009 in last hurricane. Got a sonic grey pearl CRV EX everything great so far."
CR-V,Edmunds,"There is a national car shortage of new cars and most dealers will laugh when presented with advertised lease specials.  We had a 2009 Honda Accord EX-L which had been mostly rock solid and had 129,000 miles, mostly trouble free.  One Saturday I took it in for a scheduled oil change.  The dealer is literally within eyesight of my house.  While there I strolled around and was shocked to see only one new vehicle in the showroom. The front lot was full of used cars for the most part.  I then observed a 2021 CRV EX-L AWD in Sonic Pearl Gray.  The dealer had 2 grand of add ons plastered on.  I started talking to a salesman and the story was a lady had ordered it and didn't like the color upon seeing it on the lot.  It had 10 miles on it and it was the only CRV they had. On impulse alone  I told the salesman to write up a lease based on their loaded sticker.  So I paid a few bucks over list and I don't care.  It's the way things are at the moment. Two days later I sold the 2099 Accord to the first person who came to look at it.   The CRV is a good, solid reliable vehicle with many good features.  And decent gas mileage.  I also have another vehicle with a 250 HP V8 and I like the acceleration of the CRV.  It isn't a Lexus nor is it meant to be. The leather interior is comfortable,  passable  and fine for everyday use.  There is plenty of room in the rear for storage.  I like the power rear gate.  The turbo engine is more than adequate.  The stop/go feature is annoying but easily disabled.  We plan on keeping Sirius.  The sound system is above average.    In short, it's the first new car I have  bought in over 50 years and I'm impressed with the fit and finish.  It's quiet enough for me and both my wife and I enjoy driving it.  Love the memory seat function although I also have it on the other car this one is more accurate.  We leased it for 3 years and at that point we will decide to buy or lease again.   In the meantime I am looking for a dealer who will give me a Pilot for the advertised lease price from corporate Honda.  Maybe in a couple of months.  For now, we have the CRV and we're satisfied.   

Update. April 2022. After 6 months we have put 4,000 miles on the vehicle.  The memory seats are very handy  Mileage for our shorts trips is about 18 MPG   The occasional highwayvtrip is in excess of 30.  It's a smooth car we like it.  So far, so good."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Just after 60 miles, yes a new 2021 cr v with leather, waiting at a light all the warning indicators came on . The engine didn‚Äôt  totally shutoff. I was only able to drive only 10 miles an hour looking at the dash flashing every code in the vehicle. Was instructed by the service manager to try to drive it into the dealership, which I did. Took me over an hour to go a few miles. After an hour was told the composed to be relearned? REALLY?
I can t tell you how angry I was. At this point
I can t trust the car. With COVID still around I don t need my wife and grandchildren to be stranded. Right now I m stuck with a vehicle I no longer want. I changed from Toyota to Honda hoping to get a better vehicle. Boy did I make a mistake. I don t know what to wish for more problems so I can claim a lemon law vehicle or just hope for best.
I guess I have to hope this was a one off problem and a reboot was all that was needed, but trying to get my wife back in the car will be a challenge."
CR-V,Edmunds,"This is our sixth new Honda, covering the last 40 years.  All of these vehicles have been very dependable, low maintenance, fine driving, and extremely safe vehicles.  The new CRV is a fine addition to Honda's history of fine vehicles.  I feel for those who have had a bad experience, but with Honda it's normally the exception rather than the rule."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I needed a gas sipper to put a lot of miles on. I had grown accustomed to driving my spouse's bmw and didn't realize how very weak the engine in this car is. It has no power. Other than that, it is well appointed. The style is modern and the cabin is roomy and comfortable. The four stars is for overall, but the engine gets one star."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I got my crv in April. I have 6k miles on it, just got an oil change only 2 weeks ago. The check engine oil message is already on. I tried resetting inside the setting but it still occurs every 10 secs while driving. So annoying. I though Honda was supposed to be reliable. Oil issues with the 1.5T, think before buying or leasing this thing. I can‚Äôt wait to trade in with something else"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Travel to Outer Banks NC in July 2021, first long trip using the navigation. For starters it is not a user friendly app. The navigation only routes one way. Only changes can be made while car is stopped and in park, in slow moving traffic on I-95 it presents a problem, system selects reroute but does not show the route. Finally just turned off navigation and used my I Phone, much better than the useless Navigation in Touring model. Honda selling the CRV Touring as the best, but has the public fooled. The Honda engineers should drive using this navigation system in real world traffic. Avoid the Touring models as this is not worth the extra $$. The EX-L is far superior to the Touring. I know in the future that I will have no vehicle with Navigation."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Wow!  The features in this SUV are sustainable. Automatic high beams, Apple CarPlay, reverse camera, sun roof, the list just goes on an on. It‚Äôs a great ride and I would tell anyone looking for a SUV this have a lot of value for the price!"
CR-V,Edmunds,"We drove comparable models from Subaru, Toyota, and Mazda.  The Honda CR-V wins hands down as far as price, amenities, comfort, quietness inside, cargo space, pickup. responsiveness and handling.  Nothing comes close at this price point."
CR-V,Edmunds,"We bought the LX because we eventually it will be inherited by my 12 yr old son when he goes to college.  The 2021 LX model has bad ergonomics compared to base models of Civic and Accord.  The LCD screen is very small, you will have to squint to look closely because the quality is also poor.  I hope there is an aftermarket upgrade for this.  No audio jack?  Cmon.  At least provide 2 USB if you cant provide an audio jack like what they have on the base Civic and Accord.  No power source for the rear passenger.  How much would that be for an LX.  Lastly, the auto idle stop and hand breaks are the most annoying features.  Both are confusing.  The hand break is electronic which is a user experience downgrade compared to the normal push with your feet.  The auto idle stop is the most irritating feature I have ever seen.  The default is always activated.  There is no way around it.  We hesitated on an EX.  For the money spent on an EX, better spend it on a V6 Passport or Pilot."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I truly love this car. It has so many updated new accessories and technology. It has the wheel assist along with sensors when switching lanes, sunroof, Apple CarPlay, heated seats. When getting too close to a car it will start breaking on its own. If you don‚Äôt drive between the lines and slowly swerve it takes control of the wheel and merges you back into the lane. It also has push to start and a remote start. Not to mention it‚Äôs amazing on guess and very reliable. You can‚Äôt go wrong with this car."
CR-V,Edmunds,"They do not discount theses vehicles much below MSRP.  But, still a great value.  Great ride, great handling and great gas mileage, around 34 mpg."
CR-V,Edmunds,"When my BMW X3 lease was up, I needed the affordability of the CR-V.  I went with the EX-L so I could enjoy some of the same amenities I was accustomed to in my X3. I love the leather seats and warmers.  The sunroof is a plus.  I‚Äôm very impressed with the size. The CR-V has much more legroom in the back seat. It‚Äôs easy for little ones to climb into. The rear cargo area fit all of our luggage for a family of 4 road trip. Eventually we may need something bigger, but this is suitable for now.  I love the gas mileage and efficiency. The adaptive cruise and lane keep assist are new to me, and I love these features on a long road trip. The infotainment system has given me no trouble and Apple Car Play is great to have. I love the extra USB ports. They definitely come in handy for charging multiple devices. 

I‚Äôve driven literally every car in this class, and the CR-V has been my favorite by far. Though it can‚Äôt compete with the performance and experience of the X3, it has some punch - more than expected. Overall this is a great car for getting the job done safely and affordably!"
CR-V,Edmunds,Make sure you visit many dealers as the price varies considerably!
CR-V,Edmunds,"Honda CR-V is a great, reliable car. It drives well & has great gas mileage which I like a lot.  I like the touring, as it has a larger navigation screen as well as other nice features."
CR-V,Edmunds,Awesome car!  I did have to buy a seatbelt extended for the back seats because they are backwards and also don‚Äôt extend.
CR-V,Edmunds,"Love this car! I loved my Accord but wanted an SUV type vehicle. This vehicle has lots of great features, gets good gas mileage, is roomier than my Accord and the price is right!"
CR-V,Edmunds,I've owned 6 crvs. I usually trade every 4 years. From the first to the fifth I just had to learn the new changes which were always for the better. My 2020 touring model is my least favorite. The engine is noisy and I don't care for the dying engine T stop lights.  One more thing to go wrong and has to be shut off with every start. Don't care for humps over the front wheels which is a little distracting when parking. But what I miss beyond words is Lane watch which is the right side camera. Can't believe it isn't even an option. The flashing symbol on the mirror is a joke. Totally useless. I wanted a certain color so trusted the salesman and bought before delivery because I've had 5 other crvs. Big mistake.
CR-V,Edmunds,Great ride with all the bells and whistles. Our choice because Honda is known for their reliability. Smooth and comfortable ride and we were able to get the color and all the extras we were looking for.
CR-V,Edmunds,A lot roomier inside than I thought.  Very quite smooth ride. Stereo is awesome. All computerization inside very easy to learn. Love my features that come with this model.
CR-V,Edmunds,"We bought a Honda for the confidence in engine and overall reliability, and CRV for cargo space. I expect those to deliver over time. However, other manufacturers quality ratings have become very similar. The fit and finish of the CRV are frankly not impressive - I‚Äôm noticing more light plastic as time goes on, and the value vs what we paid for vehicle and accessories is lower than we have gotten from Honda previously."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I sold my Honda Civic and bought a CR V a few months ago. I have 20,000 miles on my car already and I have driven most of them in the highway.
A noticed that the car shakes when driving on the highway. A few weeks ago, I was on the highway and opened my back windows; the car was shaking, my doors shook so hard, I thought they were going to fly away. I thought something fell off and my car was going to break. A few moments after panicking, I thought to put the windows up and that was that. It was scary, and now I drive more aware and I am thinking that this car is too light. 
When driving it in the highway, it shakes like going through a hurricane. (I know about this, I live in Florida.) 
I am really disappointed and I sent an email to Honda and just a case number but nothing else. I am thinking in selling it and changing brands."
CR-V,Edmunds,This a a great and comfortable car. It is also a very safe car. It has a very advanced techbology.
CR-V,Edmunds,"12 way power heated driver seat is the most comfortable! Perfect size vehicle, love all the options! Great color and love the rims! I am very pleased and happy I purchased my 2021 Honda CR-V from Honda of Ocala! Great Teamwork!"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Just over 800 miles. We love it. Traded in a jeep renegade. After 2 years driving the jeep this car is like a luxury vehicle. It's quiet, comfortable, and better gas mileage. We are very happy with our choice. Can't say enough about this car. Great car, good price. Was a bit concerned with the small 1.5 motor but it has enough power and is pretty quick when in sport mode. All in all a very solid car for the price."
CR-V,Edmunds,"You don‚Äôt even have to take a test drive. You‚Äôll love this Honda and everything about it. Well almost everything. Don‚Äôt like these high tech features like lane changing warning or blind spot warning and a few others. But good news is you can turn them off if you want to.
Quiet supple ride with nice handling and good acceleration with the standard turbo.
And if you like roominess this vehicle is for you. Lots of room up front and in the back."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Honda is by far the best u can buy. The CRV is our 3rd, wouldn‚Äôt buy anything else."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I didn't do enough research before buyimng this.I had a 2005 but got hit by a deer and ran out and bought this even though it felt a lot different.First of all,it is too big.They took a nice compact vehicle and made it as big as a whale.Then it has a CVT and a turbo.Are you kidding me?This thing won't last 50,000 miles.Look for something else"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Live my Honda Cr-V.  This is my third.  I will never have another car.  Very sturdy, drives wonderfully, very comfortable and has all of the amenities.  Truly a drivers dream"
CR-V,Edmunds,"This is my 2nd Honda CR-V. The best car I have ever driven. Great mileage, fairly quiet, plenty of room, rides well, etc. I rate this car and the purchase from Atamian Honda 5 Stars."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Love the simplicity of the classic interior features, too many buttons produces too many distractions in my opinion. Owned a Toyota Rav before and I loved it as well but it got handed down and Momma got a new whip! I love it and it is highly comparable to the Rav!"
CR-V,Edmunds,"Have had nothing but problems with the car since we bought it brand new. Hardly any mileage on it. 
6 months in and 
The heated seats are terrible. They are hardy warm and do not stay warm or on. 
The charging/ electrical system is faulty. Charging ports disconnect and stop charging phone and the screen on the car also glitches or just freezes. 
The automatic breaking system is also faulty and has braked for no reasons. 
There is also a bad odour when the AC is on.
None of these were evident upon purchase. We are not thrilled."
CR-V,Edmunds,"I love this vehicle. Its safe, ergonomic, smart af, smart layout and gorgeous. My favorite vehicle!"
CR-V,Edmunds,"I made a huge mistake of sinking my iPhone to my car. Now, my calls and messages are messed up, my steering display shows different from the display on main screen. It is the most user unfriendly display I have ever seen. It is unbelievably frustrating.  Stay away from this car"
CR-V,Edmunds,Very impressed with the test drive. Chose this car based on reviews by Edmunds and Consumer Reports.
CR-V,Edmunds,Trust me I change cars every 4 to 6 months I cannot keep one more than six months I had all different type of vehicles from sedans to small midsize to 3 row SUVs I had such as Mazda CX 5 and CX 9 Toyota RAV4 and highlander Mercedes GLE 350d and Lexus RX 350 ford edge all were 2016 and newer and the list goes on and on but this CRV was the most disappointing vehicle I've ever own in my life very very lugging acceleration extremely loud engine cheap very cheap interior when al plastic when you shut the doors feels like car is falling apart the only benefit owing this vehicle is yes it is cheap on gas but that's about it there is absolutely nothing else to like about this car if you are on a market for an SUV I highly mean highly suggest you look at the Mazda CX 5 comparing the CX 5 to this it's like day and night they are just not comparable at all.
CR-V,Edmunds,Very happy with my new Honda!!!
CR-V,Edmunds,Looked at other comparable SUVs but felt safest in this one
CR-V,Edmunds,The new cabin seems larger and more comfortable.  The car looks taller and sits higher than my 2018 CRV.  It's a very nice ride - I'm impressed so far.
CR-V,Edmunds,"Great gas mileage, comfortable ride"
CR-V,Edmunds,Great everyday vehicle.
CR-V,Edmunds,Shop around & do research.
CR-V,Edmunds,That is a nice and comfortable car nice technology
CR-V,Edmunds,Nice car so far. Hope it still run for at least 5 years. I am not a big fan of too much electronic. Electronic will cease to work after a coupes of years.
CR-V,Edmunds,Great car for the money.
CR-V,Edmunds,Very smooth to operate.
CR-V,Edmunds,I have had my 2021 CRV 2 months.  I am now unable to open trunk üò° I guess I need to call dealership in am. There is nothing in manual or online I can   see.  Had multiple issues with vin number being incorrect through dealerships.  All in all I love the way it drives .
CR-V,Edmunds,All new cars have that new car smell. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the off gassing of formaldehyde and other toxic gasses in the seats and dashboard. I am very sensitive to those gasses and I got very sick from the drive home from the dealership. Kept the window open and the a/c on but I still got sick. I‚Äôve been keeping a big fan running in the car with the windows open when I‚Äôm not using the car. The smell is finally dissipating. These car manufacturers need to stop using these toxic chemicals. Last time I get a brand new car. Next one will be used.
CR-V,Edmunds,Great suv in price range under 35k.
CR-V,Edmunds,Safety features are great!
CR-V,Edmunds,"I bought a 2021 CR-V EX-L taking for granted that in this time and age it would have a built-in navigation system, but it doesn't. You can connect your phone (not user-friendly) and use your internet for navigation. What will happen when there's no internet available while you are on a road trip? For sure Honda will not guide you."
CR-V,Edmunds,Muy economico comodo y actrativo
CR-V,Edmunds,Love my new Honda CR-V Touring.  Great vehicle...
CR-V,Edmunds,Test drive and feel
CR-V,Edmunds,It‚Äôs a Magical car and is luxury to me
CR-V,Edmunds,This car is easy to drive and is great for bringing home groceries and bulky items
CR-V,Edmunds,"Reliability, attractiveness, luxury and affordability."
CR-V,Edmunds,If all the bells and whistles aren't for you great. It allows $$$'s for extended warranties and maintenance plans. The vehicle itself is very nice and roomy
CR-V,Edmunds,"Love the room, look, and how it drives."
CR-V,Edmunds,"The perfect small SUV.... Plenty of space, nice ride, great features"
CR-V,Edmunds,Welcome to my family Midnight! Thank you for making my car buying experience special!
CR-V,Edmunds,"Great car!  Size of an SUV, but drives like a car.  Very comfortable with great features"
CR-V,Edmunds,The best drive feel ever. Smooth. Quick. Silent. Safe. I LOVE üíï my Honda. I even named her :)
CR-V,Edmunds,Best car I ever owned! Love my new car
CR-V,Edmunds,Love every aspect!
CR-V,Edmunds,So far 5000 miles it has performed well except mpg lower then advertised 27 mpg but should be higher then that
CR-V,Edmunds,"Let me count the ways I hate this car. First, I live in Alaska where it gets cold (shocking). This car DOES NOT HEAT UP. The weak autostart only starts it for 10 minutes so I got a new one. Even after 25 minutes of autostarting it doesn't fully heat up. AND, when I'm in it, blasting the defrost, or when it's just on, the air bounces off the windshield into my eyes. Oh yeah, and when I want heat on my feet, GOOD LUCK. Onto #2- There is no lip or gap between the roof and the windshield so if it rains, the water just pours down onto my windshield constantly. Oh, it angers me so. #3- I am not a small woman nor am I large woman, but the seats are uncomfortable. #4- Why not just make it easy to add apps and widgets to the screen? I cannot figure it out for the life of me, and I am not dumb (I don't think).  As for the performance of the car, I get approx 22 MPG city driving.. It drives fine. That's the only plus."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Great car for the money. Took it for a short trip and enjoyed the ride and mileage. Comfortable but every car on the road looks like it, Why do they always ask for reviews right away? Maybe afraid it won't do as well after a few miles."
CR-V,Edmunds,"Perfect vehicle for small families and active grandparents. Great car for ferrying kayaks. Handles well, inspires confident driving. Honda safety sensing systems are awful but I don‚Äôt have any comparisons. Maybe all cars have issues with this."
CR-V,Edmunds,"The car itself is good, has nice standard packages cloth seats are comfortable and ive had very little issues with infotainment. Comfortable car and good looks but it handles terrible, especially when your making left or right turns from a signal you basically have to turn the steering twice to get a nice turn and ive owned SUVs from toyota and turning radius has never been an issue. irs just too loose on the CRV"
Tucson,Edmunds,I traded my 2020 Sonata in for a Tucson value. I needed an SUV for practicality and health reasons.. all I can say is I‚Äôm very happy with Tucson Value I bought.comfortable and quiet ride. Easy to get in and out of and good storage. I thought performance and fuel consumption would be a down side of buying this car. Fuel consumption on a long highway run doing around 80 mph was just over 34 mpg. About 30 mpg running around locally. So better than I anticipated. Performance wise. It‚Äôs adequate and if you need more zip I can select Sport mode. All in all I‚Äôm happy with my choice.
Tucson,Edmunds,"I love my Tucson Limited. I originally test drove the Value trim and like other reviews didn't like the acceleration and wanted more features. The Limited has all that and then some. The 2.4 is way more responsive and I love my heated steering wheel, leather heated seats and xfinity sound system!"
Tucson,Edmunds,Smooth ride...getting 33mpg which is better than suggested which is great..nice storage area and rides very well.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Comfortable seating, roomy inside, but doesn‚Äôt feel boxy.  Smooth quiet ride, no problems with acceleration up hills or on highway.  Dash controls smartly placed, not overwhelming."
Tucson,Edmunds,"I've had the Tuscon Value for about a month now. I love the amount of features it has (personal favorite: auto hold button and Blue Link service). The seats are nice and firm. Some people have criticized the cheap look and feel of the interior but think of this car as practical and functional rather than for luxury. The cargo space is great and Hyundai is very generous with its included accessories. The worst thing about the car is the mpg and lack of acceleration. I fill up on average a week and a half even though I don't drive it long distances. If you can overlook this, you won't regret your purchase."
Tucson,Edmunds,"I bought a 2021 Hyundai Tucson Ultimate because I prefer the size over a Santa Fe and I have been extremely pleased with it.  It has a great, smooth, quiet ride, a solid feel and lots of nice tech.  And I LOVE that Sport Mode and panoramic roof!  The internet keeps touting the ""new"" model with a few extra lights on the front, the odd looking wheels and the dents in the side.  I think mine is MUCH prettier, ""tougher"" looking and well...just more expensive looking.  I think Hyundai makes really great vehicles though and I have bought Hyundai for the past several years.  Just glad I bought my Tucson when I did."
Tucson,Edmunds,"That Hyundai is so much more bang for your buck and having come from the Toyota and Honda world, you will be much happier with this brand!"
Tucson,Edmunds,"The SEL model is a good all around vehicle with lots of safety features, high road clearance making it great for those who deal with snow, has a simple to use infotainment center, smooth ride with lots of extras like heated seats and mirrors."
Tucson,Edmunds,Purchased a 2021 Tucson SEL 2 months ago. Smooth ride and lots of options for the money. Getting 27 miles per galleon in the City and 32 on the highway.
Tucson,Edmunds,I love my Tucson! Rides smooth and comfortable. Just enough space to where you don't feel like your driving a tank but plenty of room to stretch out in.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Just purchased a few days ago but so far so good. Rides nice and has so many included options I doubt I'll every learn how to use them all. Comfortable driver, passenger and rear seats. Hope to get a lot of trouble free years from this good looking vehicle."
Tucson,Edmunds,"Nice looking, smooth ride, love that way it rides on the highway."
Tucson,Edmunds,"What a surprise! I've been a Honda/Acura driver all my life, but read a lot of reviews on the Tucson. Once I test drove it, I knew it was the car for me. Absolutely love the way it handles and its many features. It's actually fun to drive.  Highly recommend the Tucson"
Tucson,Edmunds,"I have had my 2021 Tucson Limited for about a month, after driving a Subaru Legacy for a decade. So far, County me impressed. I love the extra room and safety features on the Tucson. The leather trim and heated seats provide a touch of luxury.
The lengthy warranty offers peace of mind, and my dealer includes free oil changes for life. All signs of the quality of the vehicle.
The front window offers a great view but the rear view is slightly obscured by the back seat head rests.
There is more than enough pep in the engine for me, but there is a slight drop in fuel economy. The only other quibble is the wind noise when it is howling outside... not unbearable but noticeable.
I anticipate loving my Hyundai for many Mike‚Äôs to come."
Tucson,Edmunds,Great car with unbeatable warranty. Hyundai is so confident in their manufactured car they warranty bumper to bumper for 5 years - 60k and 10 years 100k on powertrain. Other manufacturers only offer standard 3 years 36k bumper to bumper and 5 years 60k powertrain. Why? Aren't the other car manufacturers as confident in the quality of their product? Answer - No they are not.
Tucson,Edmunds,"In the 4 months, I've owned this car I've had to use roadside assistance 3 times. The car just wouldn't start. After 2 times service it was determent that I had a faulty battery. Also, this car doesnt have a compass and to use Homelink to open the garage door the car must be on, I repeat...If you turned the car off BEFORE oppening your garage door you'll have to turn it back on in order to use Homelink.The rear door will open automatically if you stand near it for even a very short period of time with you key on you, whether you want it or not. I see this as a sefety issue. Android auto has very poor resolution on the screen and is very unreliable, it keeps getting disconnected. If you do get this car I recommend getting it with the good old navigation system. Pros: Price, nicely appointed interior, comfortable quiet ride.
I feel I've made a mistake getting this car."
Tucson,Edmunds,Great response and economy
Tucson,Edmunds,"I upgraded from a 2018 Tucson to a 2021 Tucson, even after exploring other Hyundai model options. It‚Äôs just a great car. Very spacious, drives and handles well, and gets the job done. Very reliable and some new upgrades like lane assist, as well as a sleeker design. You can‚Äôt go wrong."
Tucson,Edmunds,I have owned Hyundai Kia Products products for years. This is my first SUV with the brand. I love it I think the ride is very composed and smooth. The Infinity sound system is really clear and bumps the bass. I am eager awaiting the release of the Santa Cruze and hope it performs as well as the Tuscon.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Honestly, in the compact SUV segment, the 2021 Tucson is not the best in anything, but it is very good in everything.  With the excellent price, excellent safety ratings, and best warranty over its competitors, it was the right vehicle for my wife to shuttle our 2 kids around town for the next 5-10 years (or more).  The ride and the seats are a little firm, but still comfortable.

My one gripe is there is no trip odometer!  I don't think that's a deal breaker for anyone, but seems an odd choice by Hyundai not to provide it."
Tucson,Edmunds,Had a like vehicle in the past but this one far outdoes the older vehicle.
Tucson,Edmunds,"I traded my 2017 Electra for 2021 ultimate. Beautiful sleek vehicle in Hyundai style. High end vehicle with many bells and whistles but yet lacks the simple things like no fob remote ( BlueLink only), wireless charging. Super annoying to purchase a top trim and still have to pay extra for mud flaps.. seriously?!?!!
The vehicle is a nice smooth ride and I hope to get many years from it"
Tucson,Edmunds,I really like the car for the money. The customer service was great too.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Just bought the 2021 Tucson sport and have to say so far it is one of the nicest vehicles I‚Äôve ever driven and that‚Äôs over 45 yrs !! Comfortable, great ride , all safety features ! Can‚Äôt say enough"
Tucson,Edmunds,"I call it ""simply the best"" because it has it all..smooth on the road, roomy inside and a classy look everything's  perfect.."
Tucson,Edmunds,I bought a 2021 tucson ultimate. The cameras are blurry and it is a common complaint that hyundai needs to address. When you buy the top trim with leather interior you would expect more leather on the door panels. The infotainment display is slow to respnd to voice commands. I suggest moving the blind spot warnings to the interior as in some day time conditions they are difficult to see. I have the 2.4l engine with the 6 speed. The engine is smooth and has good power. The transmission shift are smooth also. The ride is a little firm but not harsh. The fit and finish are very good. As with any product there is room for improvement such as fuel millage. I am happy very happy with the over all product.
Tucson,Edmunds,"I had a Tucson a few years ago, traded it for a Kona, went back to the Tucson, I love it, size, ride, it's perfect!!"
Tucson,Edmunds,"Coming from a 2012 Santa Fe which got over 180K absolutely trouble free miles, we shopped Hyundai products extensively and for 2021 the Tucson Sport with all of the features, safety, upgrades, and Hyundai reputation seemed like the perfect fit for us. This is my wife's car and compared to the older Santa Fe, is actually roomier and much more comfortable. Even for me, the seats are large enough and perfectly bolstered to hold you firm while driving. Smooth and comfortable, the ride lacks nothing. Brakes and steering are actually much better than expected. And we love the Sport styling. We got ours brand new, out the door, with complete roof rack and other extras for less than 27,500.00. Our Santa Fe does have a 3.5 V6 and by comparison the Tucson with the 2.4 does not accelerate the same. But, it is more than enough to merge, and move out of the way if needed. Given all of the other features and comforts, it is good trade off. And, sport mode helps this if you find it necessary."
Tucson,Edmunds,I had a 2015 before and I live it. This new one however made me fall in love with the tuscon all over again. I am and will remain a Hyundai girl!!
Tucson,Edmunds,"Love it, quiet ride, nice and comfortable, all kinds goodies on it, fuel mileage could be a bit better I think! All in all, great vehicle!"
Tucson,Edmunds,"We just bought the car and immediately drove from Bradenton to Long Island NY...very comfortable ride...great lumbar support. We had quite a bit of rain and she handled beautifully. Best wipers ever. Nothing bad to say , really."
Tucson,Edmunds,"I love my new SUV. I have bought 2 Hyundai Sonatas. I loved them, but wanted a change. I wanted a small SUV that was as easy to maneuver as a car, and had great gas mileage as my midsized car. I have found that with my Tucson. I love the features, and the roominess. I am obsessed."
Tucson,Edmunds,"This is our second Tucson. More HP and bells and whistles on this new one.
So much more for the money than Toyota can offer. Very, very happy with our new 2021 Tucson!"
Tucson,Edmunds,It‚Äôs a nice all around SUV!
Tucson,Edmunds,Know your information of what you plan to spend and stick to it.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Papa bear bought the Santa Fe, and Mama Bear bought the Tucson.  Perfect"
Tucson,Edmunds,"I needed a car and I didn‚Äôt want another GM, I had a 2014 Chevy Malibu, that was nice inside and out but the engine has a defect I it that GM needs to deal with"
Tucson,Edmunds,the car is a beauty
Tucson,Edmunds,Love this car - although basic - so annoying that opening trunk hatch has to be manual. Hands are always full when opening/ closing. Sort of punishing to have to put everything down or pick up to open trunk hatch. It‚Äôs a deal breaker.
Tucson,Edmunds,"Exterior looks fine.  Decent interior room.  Seats are fine.  Noise, low wind noise, high tire noise, suspension was noisy, quieted down after some miles.  MPG with a good mix of driving is low to mid 20's.  Steering, sloshy sensation especially when you let off & get back on the accelerator.  Alignment is fine.  Power, has a delay when you first accelerate then it goes.  If you need to go somewhere quickly forget it especially on the freeways.  Press and wait.  Engine noise is decent.  Brakes are grabby trash.  No sensation of warping.  Cheap windshield glass, be sure to get glass coverage."
Tucson,Edmunds,"This vehicle has been everything I‚Äôd hoped for and more. Great ride, plenty of cargo space, good gas mileage. I was a first time Hyundai owner but this will not be my last. Love this vehicle."
Tucson,Edmunds,"I am so glad I leased the last body style. I am not a fan of the new ones looks.  I love everything about this Tucson.  The truck looks amazing In the charcoal gray color with the chrome grill.  I got the limited.  Love the heated seats, and steering wheel.  I love the remote start from the app and also the infinity sound system.  Gas mileage is good for me and the car is very comfortable.  I am not sure if I will buy out the lease but since I don‚Äôt like the new one I may"
Sportage,Edmunds,"2021 Kia Sportage SX Turbo, Pacific Blue with Beige interior package (really tan with charcoal edges, HOT! It has every smart safety upgrade, including the fact it can park itself either by backing into a slop or parallel. And then it can unpark itself. It has lane departure, but also will keep one in the lane utilizing adaptive cruise control as you go. Front and back avoidance and braking functions for the unexpected. On and on I could go. I agree with the other reviews about the interior and of course the spectacular panoramic roof (one touch). The glass all around is tinted fading to a lighter tint in front. The roof is tinted, doesn't glare as light pores in, feels cool and refreshing. The SPORT mode in driving as the Turbo to break out of the cage and be the tiger it is. Otherwise NORMAL and ECO modes feel just fine, more than enough power. While it may not be the very top it certainly comes in nice enough. Consider the paddle shifters on the back side of the steering wheel as a case in point, so VERY EASY to use. Infosys allows for every contingency in multiple ways to access. The adaptive cruise control drives, brakes, and adapts to the flow without a hitch, a major relief in itself. The lack of memory for the seats is a bummer but I can live with it. Even the thickness of the steering wheel feels just right. Easy vehicle to drive. 19"" tires lend a sense of security and handling wherever I go. The back cargo space has a spare tire and other space when you lift the lid for storage. It also drops in the event of a taller than normal box. This is a keeper. I wouldn't get the AWD unless I needed it. The mileage is better around town than I expected, 24.5 mpg average. Max they say is 28 mpg on the Hwy. I wonder with adaptive cruise control it won't be better than that (slightly - maybe 30 mpg.)"
Sportage,Edmunds,I bought one; traded in my 2016 Turbo; don't try to sell me anything else. I've looked at infinity (had two and loved them) but for quality and value this is my choice!
Sportage,Edmunds,"Having driven luxury SUV‚Äôs the past 20 years, this new Sportage turbo is fun to drive.  Most of the amenities you find in LEXUS models are available with a few omissions, yet at saving about 20k on the sticker price balances the purchase. The touchscreen apps and navigation are far easier to maneuver in the KIA than others.  Seating is comfortable but could be improved with a more sporty wrap around seat and it rides a little high in the cab for me.  The expansive sunroof is killer.  The things I miss are seat memory, seat belt release driver seat back up, one touch window up & down...spoiled I know.  Over all the Sportage was a good financial exchange for us.  My husband drives a SOUL, that‚Äôs what made us check out the other vehicles in the KIA line up."
Sportage,Edmunds,The Kia Sportage is a great SUV. It fits me and my four grandchildren comfortably. It has a good amount of cargo space in the hatchback. Great on gas mileage. Handles great. A lot of good features available. Great midsize SUV. I have had 4.
Sportage,Edmunds,Do your homework as I did and you'll make the same decision.  It ticks all my boxes for my needs and I get so many compliments.  We live in snow county and this SUV is a dream on the roads
Sportage,Edmunds,Loved the 2018 and the 21 has more options
Sportage,Edmunds,Love my new car. Love the sportage. Its the perfect in between car. Not too big and not too small.
Sportage,Edmunds,Bought the 2021 Kia Sportage LX. Has everything but nav. Leather. Sunroof. Compared with Honda CRV. Toyota Rav4. Hyundai Tucson. MazdaC5. List $28700. Bought for $22450 plus total. Awesome build drive quality. Warranty best in lass.
Sportage,Edmunds,"This is one of the most comfortable and smooth-driving vehicles i have ever owned. Tight steering and throttle, and the engine seems perfectly paired with the 6-speed transmission. The paddle shifters are almost redundant, as you can down shift more smoothly with the gas pedal. It has two downshift points, you just have to find them. It floats over bumps that my 2017 Taurus would channel up my spine directly into my cranium. The seats are comfy, and every control is within reach. Everything about this vehicle just feels effortless, and that's what i want out of my daily driver. Throw in that 5-year warranty, and I might just be buying Kias for my daily driver forever."
Sportage,Edmunds,"I supposed to get the 2021 Mazda CX5 but there was a problem in the approval of my loan documents, so I decided to go to my 2nd choice which is the Kia Sportage. I am only looking for an AWD option due to my hobby of going to some small adventure for desert and seashores in the small Country of Qatar. I picked the mid option which was having the AWD but when I finally collected the car, it was like a huge bomb dropped in front of me. I side mirrors, open when I get close to the car, and I can start the engine in as far as 10 meters from the vehicle. Going inside is just a press of a button and a push button start. There is a auto dimming rear view mirrors and a full roof of glass sun roof which can be physically opened halfway. Off road modes also present as I saw the center locking differential button and the hill descend control. Infotainment doesn't represent any branding but the sound is still top notch. Both driver set and front passenger set are electric adjustable only lumbar is added in the driver set. The inside cabin design is two toned  and very luxurious feel. Hand brakes are not electronic since its actually a foot brake but I didn't bother. The package also comes with a standard spare tire and aluminum wheel. Sets are very comfortable specially with the addition of the rear ac vents. Cabin is very quiet only you can hear the engine growl from 2000 rpm and higher. Steering is very good just a small indirect feeling but its not very noticeable not unless you have driven a Mazda CX5 for a long time. Setting position is very commanding and sets are perfect and very comfortable. Only I can say is, that this option is very close to the full option. The followings items are the only things making the gap being full a full option (adaptive cruise control, lane departure and lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert and stopping, electronic parking brake, paddle shifters, wireless phone charger, blind sport monitor, LED headlight, 19 inch wheel, power lift gate and full leather sets. But still Kia is giving us a very useful features that no other car making can do. Kudos Kia."
Sportage,Edmunds,"Test drive car and learn all the features the suv has to offer, it is awesome. You will love it"
Sportage,Edmunds,"I test drove the rav4, mazda 5, rogue, crv, terrain, equinox, edge, etc. Out of all of them, this was by far the most comfortable and comparable to my 2012 gmc terrain slt in size, seat comfort, and gadgets.
I love my 2021 sportage EX. Great hot heated seats. Drove some that barely got luke warm. Love the screen and blind spot warning (not a nuisance) as it really has only sounded off as needed. I love all of the features. It drives like a traditional car without the whining of the CVT transmissions. I have been getting better fuel economy than advertised. 26-27 combined.
Hopefully, this will be a mechanically sound vehicle (to soon to tell), but so far the comfort and convenience is everything I was looking for."
Sportage,Edmunds,Has all the bells and whistles. Gas mileage is not the greatest compared to other similar vehicles.  Feel safe and comfortable driving
Sportage,Edmunds,"It's a solid vehicle. The car handles well, and has very good acceleration. Front and back seats have decent room, and the cabin overall feels solid and looks good. Instrument panel is very well lighted up as are turn signals, etc. The trunk is a bit small but it works for me.  I get 23 mpg overall.   I get 30 mpg or more on highway using eco mode and cruise at 62 mph. It's a really nice car."
Sportage,Edmunds,Great car just what I wanted
Sportage,Edmunds,Nice looking car thats fun to drive.
Sportage,Edmunds,drove 39k miles...only thing i had to do was change oil
Sportage,Edmunds,I love everything about this car.
Sportage,Edmunds,Love it! Love it! very nice SUV. So far very happy purchaser :)
Sportage,Edmunds,"In general I'm a huge proponent of Korean manufacturers and all the strides they've made over the last 10 years or so. There's clear evidence of major improvements across various platforms, and investment into design and development across the entire Genesis / Hyundai / Kia lineup. 
I'll start with the good. The Sportage is a very unique looking car and is certainly not for everyone. But for those that appreciate its uniqueness, it's a wonder to look at and drive. Kia openly advertises the fact that its latest design includes components inspired by the Porsche Macan. My test drive experience of the fully loaded SX model resulted in an overall pleasant experience. I was amazed with the quality of interior, excellent heated & ventilated seats, the glass roof with a huge opening moon roof panel, the sound system, the intuitive entertainment and navigation, and the power train - the 2.0L performed wonderfully and never left me wanting more throughout its range on local streets and the highway. Nice Michelin tires were originally included with the car. One negative stood out right away - the road noise. But I was willing to live with it given all the positives. I bought the car and overall, with the exception of road noise and few corks around I still enjoy the drive a year and a half later. My FWD SX Turbo model gets me 26MPG average in an approximate 70/30 highway/local split, which isn't the greatest in its class but is respectable given the power and the cargo room it offers. The Sportage is one of those cars that's much bigger on the inside than out. It's very roomy. Most passengers can't believe how roomy and well appointed the interior is after seeing the exterior. Now on to the cons....
The Kia Sportage is the longest running model within Kia's lineup, so buying the 2021 top of the line SX trim I expected it to be completely refined with any potential issues ironed out. That was not the case, not even close. Instead, I've been having issues and non-stop dealer visits since day one. Out of the gate, day 1, the alignment was off and the car pulled to the left constantly while driving - unacceptable from a brand new vehicle and has never happened to me before (I purchased 18 brand new vehicles so far in my life). The infotainment head unit stopped working with Navigation just hanging endlessly if you try to put in an address. The head unit had to be replaced within 2 months of driving since new. There were few other body panel and door latch issues. The driver's door had to be slammed to actually latch closed. The weirdest issue by far, and the one that still haunts the car every few months and requires a dealer visit for some patch work, is the loud whistle at 50MPH coming from the left fender where the bumper seem meets the left fender. Issue occurred day one, and was in fact a LOUD whistle, I'm not exaggerating, that can be heard through music in side the vehicle and results in the most annoying drive experience you can imagine. After several dealer visits and them eventually involving Kia corporate engineers, the fix was put in place - some foaming insulation poured into the seem to fill in the gap and stop the whistle. It worked for few months until AZ heat caused the glue to separate and the panel to completely come off. The whole bumper had to then be replaced by the dealer (another week in the shop). Once replaced, the issue came back with vengeance! The seem had to be jammed open and more insulation foam went in. It's holding for now. The vehicle is about a year and a half old and it's been in the shop at least a month so far. I wish Kia included the memory driver's seat feature, at least in top trim models. We have 3 drivers in the household and constant manual adjustments are needed. I've had much cheaper vehicles that include the feature. The road noise gets worse with tire wear. I notice it more and more and it is noticed by most passengers that have experienced the competition, something like a CR-V, the CX-5 or the RAV4. Having had multiple Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia vehicles, I can say with fair certainty that the undercarriage insulation is only done correctly in their Genesis lineup. Kia and Hyundai are insulated in a minimalist fashion to save on weight and costs. My G80 was whisper quiet on the road. But then again, it cost twice as much as the Sportage. One more and final big gripe is the dealer experience. The facility, the staff, the very obvious lack of training in all areas are seriously getting to me. I dread each visit these days, even for regular maintenance. I often find myself having to tell the service specialist what to do to fix a given issue. In summary, I feel like the Sportage, being one of the oldest models in the company's lineup, could have used a little more quality control and attention to detail in its manufacturing process. This could have been a great seller and competitor, but instead falls short in areas that are actually fairly simple to address."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I moved up, way up, from a 2013 GMC Terrain. The CX5 GTR is great! The power is fantastic, the ride is soooo much smoother , and the build quality is in a different universe from the GMC. The CX5 is very quiet, the Bose sound system superb, and the turbo flat out hauls a..... I looked at RAV4, CRV, ENVISION, Santa Fe, and RDX. The RDX was the only one even close, but was way more expensive."
CX-5,Edmunds,"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are now a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety and tech features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily used without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn‚Äôt as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff ‚Äì which we don‚Äôt.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content ‚Äì if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.  
We are very happy with our new CX-5."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I just brought home a '21 Signature after owning a 2016 GT for the past 5 years and could not be happier. Mazda's approach seems to be continuous refinement which is apparent in this iteration. My priorities were driving experience--handling, ride, power, AWD snow performance--and also luxury. MPG, minor off-road capability, and cargo space were down the list. Although exterior styling is refined rather than aggressive (see the RAV4), the overall aesthetic remains appealing and the interior is at a near-luxury level. I test drove the '21 RAV4 and it drives ok but simply can't compete with CX-5 (IMO). Although if a person plans to keep a vehicle for 15 years it is hard to beat Toyota's track record.

The Bose system is impressive and the ability to adjust it to individual listening preferences is noteworthy. The new infotainment system has improved significantly over the past 5 years and I am an enthusiastic convert to the no-touch screen and console commander control wheel. The screen resolution and user interface reflect a major evolutionary improvement that was easy to learn based on prior experience. Interior surfaces and design are refined and although some reviewers complain about the lack of a panoramic roof, that was a non-issue for me as I rarely use the existing moon roof. 

My non-turbo 2016 GT was engaging and fun to drive and the '21 Signature takes these characteristics to a new level. I've had it in 4-6"" of snow and it performs very well, even with the all-season OEM Toyo A36s. I was surprised, and hopeful, that they will perform better than the A23s that came on the 2016 GT. Curvy canyon roads elicit a spontaneous smile in any weather--sun to snow.

This Signature is only my second Mazda; previously I owned multiple Subarus (Outback) and a couple Toyota Highlanders. These are great vehicles, but I've now been spoiled by Mazda. I've rented a number of compact SUVs over the past few years ranging from Jeeps to Nissans and Chevy/Fords and none impressed me like Mazdas. I did look briefly at the CX-9 but didn't need the 3rd row. 

The CX-5 Signature checks off all my boxes. Improved Mazda reliability noted by consumer groups is a nice plus and I suspect this reflects their focus on refining, improving, and tweaking existing proven technology (engines, transmission) rather than jumping to the next new thing (e.g., CVTs‚Äîughh). Their turbo has been out for several years and I am hopeful it will hold up well while helping to make the driving experience an absolute pleasure. Turbo lag is minimal, and I suspect that as I learn the throttle characteristics, it will be rare. I think that the Mazda CX-5 is a great and underappreciated (based on sales) vehicle."
CX-5,Edmunds,"This car lives up to its billing. It drives great, is relatively quiet on the highway, and the red paint job stands out in a crowd of boring white and grey cars that litter the highways. My only complaint is that the seat is too firm for my liking. It purchased a seat cushion to soften it some but then the seat cooling and heating function isn't useful. The interior design is very luxurious for a car that is inexpensive. It's a good choice for those not looking to break the bank and are okay with a small SUV."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my 2021 Signature CX-5 for 2 months now and am thrilled with my purchase. Having owned a 2009 Mazda6 in the past, I expected excellent handling and this vehicle delivers. The steering is quick and accurate with the suspension providing a firm and controlled, but not harsh, ride which I find comfortable and reassuring. The turbo is definitely a good addition to the standard engine. While not a race car, the acceleration is linear with minimal turbo-lag and more than enough from either a standing start or for passing on the freeway.

The interior is very driver friendly and near-luxury. The driver's seat is comfortable and easily adjustable. The cabin is quiet enough for conversation at normal volume even at highway speeds. The 10 inch screen is well placed so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to view. I am not a fan of using a touch screen while driving so I appreciate the control wheel and push button controls which are easy and intuitive to use. I thought having Apple CarPlay/Android Auto was a ""must-have"" for my new vehicle, however I've found that I rarely use the feature since I actually prefer navigating with the Mazda system over Google Maps and usually listen to subscription satellite radio. Nevertheless, it works well when I do connect my phone.

I also appreciate using buttons and knobs for the climate control system rather than having to navigate through screen menus. Again, a thoughtful design to make it easier to use while driving.

All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase and anticipate many miles of enthusiastic driving."
CX-5,Edmunds,"New additions are automatic folding outside mirrors, cooling seats, larger display, Android Auto, Apple Play, Bose stereo system, heated steering wheel & seats, and so many other safety features. Be sure to get the Grand Touring model."
CX-5,Edmunds,"This is my second CX-5! I previously had the 2017 CX-5 GT with the Premium Package, which was fully loaded at the time. I knew from day one that when my lease was up I would be getting another one. The 2021 is amazing in every aspect. Comfort, Features, Power. I love the upscale interior, the 10.3 inch screen to be exact! Everything from top to bottom is perfect! I recommend the CX5 to anyone looking for a CUV! It's like driving a BMW for Toyota money."
CX-5,Edmunds,"The CX 5 GTR is equipped better than most Luxury Compact SUV's.  Mazda has taken care to build the car so it's pleasing to the eye yet is very fun to drive.  It comes standard with more equipment than many Luxury brands and at a reasonable price.  The Turbo 4 has plenty of power and can run on regular fuel.  It may have less cargo space than others in the market, but is more than ample for most uses.  Originally we were looking at the Lexus NX, Acura RDX and Audi Q5, yet the Mazda comes better equipped and a far lower price.  If you are in the market for a Compact SUV, take a look at the CX 5 it will surprise you."
CX-5,Edmunds,"If you are looking for a safe, stylish, and simple car to drive, the Mazda CX-5 Touring Preferred is your best choice. It gives you leather seats, blind spot monitoring, Apple Carplay, power gate lifting, keyless entry, remote start and so much more. For a reasonable price you can get everything you need to enjoy a short or a long ride. The safety features are one of the highest in the market and the style of the car is comparable to any high-end vehicle for this class, size and price."
CX-5,Edmunds,A nice upgrade from my Honda Pilot. Sporty and so much fun to drive. So many extras make this a dream to drive. I am loving my Mazda!
CX-5,Edmunds,This is a peppy small suv.  It handles well.
CX-5,Edmunds,"The CX-5 Grand Touring (base trim - no Prem Pkg) is my second Mazda to lease, and overall I'm pretty pleased. Having come from a larger 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5 is a great CUV that fit within my current budget. Its ride is a bit on the firm side, which will take time getting used to, after having the smooth ride of the 9. The non-turbo engine, however, is peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The larger 10.25"" info screen is also really great. The one feature that falls terribly short, in my opinion, is the Bose stereo. The sound, even with the treble at its highest setting, sounds muddy and muffled, and doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose systems in the 9, the new 3's and the very new CX-30. Being in year five of its current generation, the 5 would benefit GREATLY from the same Bose 12-speaker system found in the new 3 and CX-30. That particular upgrade would raise the bar for this CUV sky-high."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I just leased a 2021 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring at the Byers Mazda on Billingsly Road in Dublin, OH. So far the vehicle works great. I wanted to upgrade from my 2018 Mazda 3 hatchback due to hip and back pain in order to assist in comfort and ease in getting in and out of the vehicle and for sitting for long periods of time. In the short time I've driven it, I've already noticed a different. I feel extra safe in this vehicle as it has so many fancy safety options that I didn't even know existed. It is a smooth ride, very quiet, and runs great! This is my third Mazda and even after looking around at other brands, I still chose Mazda. Great quality vehicles, great sales, and great service!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"While this car was originally my third choice‚Äì‚Äìand the last make and model that I test drove‚Äì‚ÄìI immediately was sold on the comfort, style, and performance. I drove it 1700 miles within two weeks of the purchase, and it was the most comfortable ride I've ever had. The safety features, the sound system, and so many other factors made the trek through mountain passes and the desert very enjoyable."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Very Happy with the car so far.  The CX-5 has plenty of power with the standard engine.  The car was purchased for my wife and she is the main driver.  She loves the Red color and the optional moon roof and the Alloy wheels.  The CX-5 has plenty of room for even for big guys like me.  I have driven the car about 100 miles so far and it handles great.  My wife on the other hand is still getting used to the handling.  Her last car was a Ford Fusion which had a much different ride. She just needs to drive it more to get used to the different handling.  I have a Chevy Traverse which has a similar ride but softer because its a larger vehicle.  Overall we are both happy with the purchase.  Wayne Mazda in NJ gave us a good deal and we would recommend them.  We narrowed down our decision to three vehicles.  The CX-5, RAV 4, and Nissan Rogue.  I had already made up my mind but my wife was undecided until she saw and I test drove the CX-5.  The style and color won her over."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I have had my 2021 CX-5 for several days now and for the most part think it is perfect. I purchased a white one in the Grand Touring Reserve trim and it has everything I could ever need. The build quality on literally everything is superb. The one issue I have with it, is in how the stereo system is controlled. There is no way to easily switch through my favorited XM stations without taking my eyes off the road and going through multiple actions on the console control system. Oddly enough, there is a way to semi-easily flip through the 100+ other stations that I don't listen to. Both the Mazda3 and the CX-30 have functionality on the volume knob that allows for switching through your favorites by pressing left or right, but when you pay more money for the CX-5, this isn't included. Overall, I love the CX-5, but if I would have known about this issue before my purchase, it may have been a deal breaker, since it creates a major distraction anytime I want to change the radio station to one of my preset favorites."
CX-5,Edmunds,"After driving an Audi Q5 for years (which I loved), I actually love my Mazda CX-5 Carbon Edition even more! It feels modern and sleek. I had no intentions of purchasing a new car, let alone a Mazda. They won me over. I am so happy with my purchase."
CX-5,Edmunds,"It has a really good ride. Are family is coming from a 2014 Buick Enclave. And the Mazda has as smooth a ride, comfort and minimal road noise as the Buick. Fuel economy was the same as the Buick as well. The engine is snappy and plenty of get up and go for traveling. I enjoyed the cruise control option. A person can go in front of you, your car slows down to maintain a safe distance, and then accelerates when able to. Automatically. The steering wheel operation keeps your mind on the road. Will be buying more Mazda‚Äôs in the future!!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"This is an excellent car. It is on a different level than Toyota, Nissan, Honda. Of course, all of them make excellent vehicles. But non of them talk to you. They are practical, some are reliable, but it is about it. This car is eye candy inside and out. I am excited to drive to and from work everyday. Fit and finish inside of this vehicle is super. I had plenty of luxury brands to compare. Car is very quite and refined. This is premium vehicle premium and one can pay for it mainstream price. Thank you Mazda. Also, seen someone complainig about Bose system. It is better IMO than Toyota's, Honda's and Subaru's that I tested. Again, for price point it is more than acceptable."
CX-5,Edmunds,"The Mazda CX-5 is a nice SUV as all the reviews agree, but it's not for everyone. The sporty image Mazda is striving for results in heavily bolstered front seats that are not comfortable for everyone. The turbo charged engine is only available on the upper trims pushing $38-40,000, and the Carbon edition with an MSRP of about $33,000. We went looking for the lower priced way to get the turbo, but dealers are treating the Carbon edition like it's already turned into a diamond, adding $5000 to the sticker plus the phoney alarm for $1300 and the Scotch tape on the door edges for $399. Dealers seem to think buyers will forgive and forget these scams when inventories grow in the next few months, but I have never gone back to one dealership that tried to screw me over in the 70's and I have put this Mazda dealership on the same list."
CX-5,Edmunds,"At 55, after buying Fords, a Maserati, and two Nissans and having driven Hondas, Toyotas and several sports cars and SUVs, I purchased my first Mazda based on commercial site reviews.  Looking for safety, reliability, and a great price with a loaded car.  Wanted to down size.  Thought I had found it in the CX-5. My test drive was short. My fault. Because I realized after driving the CX-5 the first day I bought it that that the front seats are beyond terrible. If you are over about 50 or have shoulder or back problems, avoid this car. The seats will make you suffer. We just got back from a 5 hour both ways vacation drive with less than 150 miles on the car starting out and by the time we got back we want to sell it even for a loss. Our backs and shoulders ached the whole time. The seats are so stiff, have no leg room support, and are so ergonomically painful, that no engineer who designed the seats could have driven any time in them or is a moron. We have since researched seat issues with this car and unfortunately  now know that this is a huge issue with this car. Hard to believe that a car company could design a beautiful, highly equipped, reliable and safe car that is ruined by its horrible car seats. We will be selling this brand new car at a loss because it hurts our backs and shoulders and nothing is more miserable than trying to drive a distance in pain because of short, rock hard seats."
CX-5,Edmunds,Feels like a much more expensive car than it is. Mazda has a lot of nice touches built in to the vehicle.
CX-5,Edmunds,"This model and trim is a joy to drive, make sure the sales person reveals all the adds to the window stricker price i.e, mazda price increase, dealer installed options."
CX-5,Edmunds,"After owning cx9 and 3i , surviving bad accident in the 3 , we decided on another Mazda. Had zero problems with other two. So yes we love our 2021 cx5 gt.
AwD. Daughter got two cx5 also. Reliability and fun are what Mazda's are about! # 1 consumers reports too."
CX-5,Edmunds,The 2021 Mazda CX5 handles very well. Great acceleration.  Looks very classy and I love the interior of the CX5. Very sturdy and enjoy driving it! A great vehicle for the price!
CX-5,Edmunds,"Cons: lower than competitor MPG, cargo room, somewhat boring-looking rear design, a bit chunky, visibility
Pros: Great overall design (especially the front), top-quality interior, great powertrain options. Basically everything else is top notch."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my Signature now for about 6 months and have put 10k miles on it (runs between NC and MA).

First, a shoutout to Edmunds Mazda leasing information person who responded quickly to my request.  Got it just before going into the dealership and shamed them into rolling back the 3x lease rate they wanted initially.  Great info, and wonderful responsiveness!

I had resisted going the SUV route for a long time, but the sporting drivability of this vehicle has won me over.  I love to power into corners and feel the rear-wheel steering adjustment improve the tracking is wonderful.  And yes, the suspension is stiffer than some people like, but it also improves the driving experience for me.  Take a spirited test drive if you're not sure.

Coming from an Infiniti Q50, I still miss rear-wheel drive acceleration on occasion, but it looks like the CX-5 (CX-50) will have that when my lease is up so I can live with this quibble for now.  And although the CX-5 doesn't have all the luxury bells of the Infiniti, I still love getting 90% of it at 65% of the price!

Another ding is space, for people and for storage.  I have not had any complaints about people feeling like there's not enough room for them, so not a problem for me.  I will admit to occasionally wishing for a few more inches of storage space though.  I can work through it by reclining the front passenger seat though, so no showstoppers yet on the storage side.

Fit and finish are very well done.  I wasn't sure initially about the Caturra leather being the only seating option (brown?), but it's such a rich color I love it.  Ergonomically, I would wish for more aggressively bolstered seats, but my friends all think the seats function great from their perspectives.

The non-touch screen required only a short acclimation period; the controls in the center console are easy to find by touch and then get to navigation, entertainment, or communications.  I'll grouse about my inability to use voice controls effectively, but it's most likely me.

All in all, a great first SUV for me, and a great choice for others!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"Owning a Honda Pilot for 9 years, I knew it was too big and thirsty for my current needs. But I was concerned about feeling cramped in a compact CUV. No worries there. The CX-5 was extremely comfortable, well-appointed, and packed with features for the price. I test drove a Carbon Turbo and a Touring preferred pkg at my first dealership. I had seen reviews say the base engine was a bit weak, but I found the regular engine to have plenty of pep and power. In fact, because of traffic, I didn't get to really open the turbo up during the test drive. I realized with my driving patterns, I really wouldn't have much need for the Turbo. 

The Carbon Edition is basically the Touring trim with the SV Preferred package items and some trim items unique to this level. Including a paint color called Polymetal Grey, which is actually a very sharp steely blue. It also has a different grill, black wheels, black trim around the wheel wells. On the interior, the black leather seats are accented with red stitching. A red interior is also available, which I though would look horrid, but actually looks pretty sweet in person.

As good as the car looks, it's also fun to drive. Very responsive and handles well. Loaded with safety and convenience features that make driving a pleasure. 

As I said in the title, I drove the CX-5 first, but wanted to see what else was out there. Anything else I drove just left me flat. Wasn't even close. So the CX-5 it was. Buy this car, and you'll be looking for reasons to go for a drive."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Owned probably 30 vehicles in my lifetime from pretty much every mfg. But, hadn't owned a Mazda until my wife showed up with her new grocery getter. Loaded with options for the price and some neat high end convenience. Sensing wipers, levelling headlights and a nice comfortable ride. We live just outside the city and have about 2 miles of dusty dirt roads. Six months into her vehicle she seems to be having sensor problems. I'm not talking about intermittant issues, but sensor failure. Her biggest problem is the levelling headlight sensing issues as although they have been reset a couple of times, they had to be replaced under warranty. This is a car that has 10,000 miles and is 6 momnths old. 

Have other vehicles in our driveway that are a few years older with headlight levelling and have not had an issue. So, the vehicle may be a 5* vehicle for paved roads in the city but in my opinion there are better choices for those on the outskirts."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Some dealers were competitive on the price of CX-5. Some dealers were not as responsive (3 or 4 days to respond) to our quote request and another gave us the MSRP price minus $100. What sold us with the Trade-In value we received.  There was a big disparity between dealers on the Trade-in value.   
In the price range of the CX-5 we felt we received a good value for the money.   There were better driving SUV's but once you added options we use then then the value wasn't there."
CX-5,Edmunds,"i have owned over the years 28 Mazda . i own a 2021 CX5. over all i love the car great handling super nice on the inside . i love every thing but the transmission .it some times shifts hard . but what i dont like is when i am getting on a free way where  the speed limit is 70mph . i put the trans. into sport mode. because it is faster  throught the gears . and i can keep up with the on comming cars . i put the gas pedal to the floor and very fast reach 72 mph the tack is at 6,000 rpm  and the trans wont go into drive. when i take my foot off of the gas pedal  i am now running 72 mph and i cant get the trans to go into drive  the cars in frount of me are getting closer .i am doing every thing to slow it down  so at the last min. i put the shifter into N and back into drive that worked . being i race cars on a race track .i was thinking fast on how to slow the car down . i feal that some one who .would not think fast  enought . might crash there car into some one on a free way. i have taken the CX5 back to the dealer ship  they did a update  on the trans to make shift better but it did not work . it still does the same thing . i have told mazda corp. about it and never herd back from mazda . i do know that this trans is in   the 2021 cx5 is  brand new  for 2020 and 2021    and is way different .from other mazda transmissions  i feal mazda does not have the bugs worked out yet on this new trans"
CX-5,Edmunds,"great handlng ,good safety features,beautiful red color,quick,smallish back seat,fair fuel economy"
CX-5,Edmunds,This is a great handling car. To get the same level of driving you would have to step up to more luxury brands. None of the mainstream brands come even close. Great reliability ratings. Premium interior and superior fit and finish. Quite too.
CX-5,Edmunds,Luxurious interior at a value price. Fun to drive. Standard equipment tires are not up to this cars standards.
CX-5,Edmunds,"I've just upgraded from a  2018 Mazda 3 to a  2021 CX5 .  I love them both.    They both handle well, never had any issues with the 3 and expect the same with the CX5.  Mazda has me hooked!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"Purchased a new 2021 Grand Touring w/Premium Pkg. Dark Blue w/black leather. It's FWD and non-turbo which is perfect for our driving style and region. The engine is plenty peppy and the 6 speed auto shifts like perfection. The interior is very luxurious. Heated and cooled seats. Bose stereo. Heads up display feels like you're driving a Vette. Memory seats which is great since me & my spouse both use the car and ratcheting the drivers seat manually in our old car was a pain. Now we just push a button. Wife likes the power liftgate, something our old car didn't have either. Really like the way it drives. My only complaint would be the budget tires they use. I'll give Mazda a pass but it's one shortcoming for such a fine automobile. Haven't really checked fuel mileage yet but expect 28-32 average. Plan to keep this for many years."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I have always owned Honda and Acura products, but with the shortage, and the economy, I decided to down size from my Acura MDX lease. If you notice with the shortage, lots are pretty empty.  I could have waited for the right Honda I wanted, but the Mazda's were in stock, hence the CX-5 and CX-9 rocket in sales the last two months.
 The interior of the Mazda is very nice.  All the materials feel top notch, except for the lower doors and the floor mats and carpet. Worst Floor Mats and carpet ever!  Cheap and hard to vacuum.  
The Infotainment screen is finally larger, but working it is annoying with the knob controller.  I have gotten used to it, but would not buy it again just for that.  Voice commands are not much better.
Little things like the heated steering wheel is only warm on the sides, not the top or bottom, and the button is on the console?  The power seat setting and memory is on the seat itself, and does not light up at night.  When you set your power seat, it does not set your mirrors as well, so after maintenance or car wash, I always have to adjust them, unlike my previous car which adjusted with the hit of the memory seat button
The rear headrest should be able to slide down and be flush with the back seat (Acura does) for better visibility
I got the regular 2.5 engine, as I am not a fan of Turbo's.  While it is decent enough, the transmission could be quicker.  Gas mileage is also disappointing for a 4cyl with a six speed auto.
Overall it is a very nice SUV, but with just a little stretch of that wheelbase and maybe better OEM tires, the ride could be just that much better.  I will be replacing the TOYO tires with Michelin when the time comes.  I usually only keep my cars for 3 years but did not lease, but we will see"
CX-5,Edmunds,"Things I love: 
- fun to drive 
- great handling 
- good gas mileage 
- should be very reliable 
- price was right 
- AWD handles well in rain, I suspect it will also do well in the snow 
- Carbon Edition paint makes it easy to find in a sea of CX-5s 
- the black seats with red stitching (looks magenta, in my opinion) is unique and really nice 
- the black rims are gorgeous 
- I get lots of compliments and questions about how much I like it 

Things I don‚Äôt love: it just isn‚Äôt as nice as I expected. At a glance, it‚Äôs very polished and riding around in it is plenty comfortable and seems luxurious. But, the fit/finish doesn‚Äôt impress me. The first time I cleaned it up, I noticed that anything immediately out of sight is not upholstered/finished. On that note, the carpet is hard to get clean, particularly removing dog hair (but perhaps that‚Äôs specific to my two beasts). The glossy surfaces scratch if you touch them with anything other than a fingertip and the other surfaces also seem easy to damage (four months of my six year old climbing across the back seat has scratched the rear console pretty badly; a Rubbermaid bin leaned against the dash for 20 minutes left an indentation that took a week+ to recover). The front fender popped out within the first few weeks of owning it, but I was able to pop the clip back in with some effort. 

Would I buy it again? With my budget, yes. I‚Äôm hoping it will be as reliable as three trusted mechanics (and Consumer Reports) told me it will be. However, if I had another few thousand dollars, I would pick something else."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Started out at the dealer. Test drove the cx 5 GT signature and ended up getting it home and noticed pathetic performance as it didn't have the turbo and the seats were too hard. took it back to the dealer and upgraded to the reserve thinking it was the same as the car we test drove. Turn out it had the same seats as the other and the signature had upgraded seats. I loved the acceleration with the turbo and the windshield display but that's where it ended.  the seats were too hard and driving a short distance my back was on fire, when the fuel light came on you only had a few miles to find gas and not having a touch screen was not desirable. The biggest disappointment was the height of the rocker panel. It was too high off the ground and when you had to literally climb in and the floor pan was so deep it was like getting into a swimming pool. My wife had an artificial hip and it took her several minutes just to get in and out. Installing running boards didn't even help We drove it for about three months and couldn't take it no more. We realized why drive a car that you hate. We started checking out other cars thoroughly and decided on a Honda CR-V. We took a huge hit but I'm now in a car that I thoroughly enjoy, we can get in and out of it with no problem at all and the seats are very comfortable"
CX-5,Edmunds,"Bought new in Jan.21. Wife wanted vehicle I was initially ok with it but have come to the decision that it wasn't the best for our money. Interior space is not up to the best. Interior color and black leather make for really dark,drab interior. Seats are not that comfortable. Sunroof small. Wind noise while driving with windows down very irritable, Gas mileable ok but not great (28mpg).Acceleration adequate with standard engine. Value for price adequate. Everyone loves steering, I find it uninspiring and steering wheel to thin. Whoever designed the interface for using all the car's features should be forced to use them everyday to get their pay and food; horribly laid out and frustrating. Pallette of exterior colors not very appealing. This is my 3rd Mazda and although time will tell on dependability I expect it to be good. Visabilty not up to the best in class. Vehicle looks are subjective but it's decent. Doing your own oil changes not the easiest I've seen. Truly this vehicle should have about a 3 day tutorial from Mazda on how to get the most from it. On the positive side it doesn't have the dreaded CVT tranny. Gets excellent safety ratings. Comes with a real temp.spare tire. AWD system again not the best but adequate for 90% of people. Warranty adequate but not the best. Adequate seems to be the word of the day and I was wishing for delightful,fun and enjoyable. The auto press is enamored with this vehicle, me, I wish Suzuki was still here, Subaru hadn't become PC and expensive and the new Mitsu Outlander had been available a couple of months sooner. That or I could have talked the wife into another Chrysler minivan with all of its utility, comfort and ease of access. But minivans are not cool to the female set. Sad. Ok, have now owned for 10 months and put 15k on it. Dependability as expected excellent. Still finding it irritating and somewhat uncomfortable. Sunroof is useless without some sort of wind blocker which it does not have. Same for driving with windows down, going to have to get wind blockers for them too. Mileage a bit better at 29 but drive mostly highway. Back up camera is constantly dirty or covered in water so a bit irritating. Just not feeling it as the hip people say."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I had a 2017 and 2019 Kia Ex pack Sportages. Loved them both bot no comparison to the CX5. The interior is the biggest plus. Near luxury. Design is second to none. I bought the Soul Red with white interior .... eye catching. 
In Mexico we have the S Touring model, works perfect for my needs. Extremely quite and a lot more power than the Kias. I would highly recommend!

Update: It's been 6 months plus since I bought this car. Happier today than the day I brought it home. MPG on the road in the mid to.low 30's. This is near luxury on a dime."
CX-5,Edmunds,"We test drove the Mazda CX-5 with the intention to buy it, based on favorable reviews we had read. We felt, however, that the backseat was too cramped for our three young adult sons, the engine lacked pep, and the interior was nothing special. We went with the Honda CR-V and are very pleased that we did."
CX-5,Edmunds,"The Mazda CX-5  signature is great car for the value, but it is no luxury vehicle. I traded my old BMW for this car thinking it was good choice. But I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from safety features were annoying, and the driver‚Äôs seat leather started to wrinkle after only 2 months. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car. Thankfully. I paid cash for the CX-5. I looked at several luxury vehicles and traded it for another (new) BMW X3. The BMW drives like a dream, has light interior and a panoramic sunroof. I‚Äôm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn‚Äôt cost much more than the signature. I‚Äôd rather have a true luxury vehicle for that price range. I won‚Äôt make that mistake again."
CX-5,Edmunds,We are ecstatic about our CX-5.  We color we chose is a red that looks like no other and white interior that makes it pop!  We love our new car and now huge Mazda fans!!!
CX-5,Edmunds,"Love this car! RX-7 DNA, on par with German luxury for thousands less.

We bought it two months ago, 1400 miles to date. Smooth, quiet, peppy, responsive with awesome safety features. Fit and finish is exceptional. Rides and handles as well as our BMW 3 series and reminds me of an RX-7 I had a long time ago. Averaging 24 mpg in town, 27+ highway. Roomier inside than it appears.

Only complaints are minor and nitpicks. Wish there was a knob to tune the radio stations. Many car companies don‚Äôt have these anymore. Mazda works around this with a favorites button that isn't too bad. The seat bottom cushions could be longer. Otherwise the car is perfect."
CX-5,Edmunds,"I test drove the Touring trim. Drive was not impressive; engine lacked power of other similar sized SUVs, suspension lacked refinement and comfort, and seats are designed for little people. Exterior and interior design was ho hum. I returned to the dealership after a test drive, grabbed my trade-in key and moved on. It is way over rated compared to other SUVs in the same market."
CX-5,Edmunds,Bmw and Mercedes should be concerned.
CX-5,Edmunds,"I purchased this vehicle mostly based on its safety features, but I‚Äôve quickly grown to hate driving my 2021 CX-5. The main problem is the automatic transmission. Shifting in/out of low gear(s) is horrible, accompanied by lurching and thumping, when starting or stopping but especially when cornering. The shifting is too frequent and way too rough. Aside from that, the engine (Touring) is slightly under-powered, and the braking is substantially under-powered. So this CX-5 takes forever to catch up to traffic from a stop light, then you have to press the brake pedal too much to slow to a stop, while the rough transmission is jerking the vehicle around. Unfortunately the 2021 CX-5 is garbage and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm stuck with this piece of junk until it‚Äôs paid off, but I‚Äôm so glad we hung onto our older (2016) CX-3 so I can just leave this horrible CX-5 in my garage until I can get a better replacement vehicle ‚Ä¶ I doubt I will ever consider buying another Mazda after owning this CX-5, despite being quite happy with our Mazda CX-3, CX-9 and MPV. It‚Äôs just too awful."
CX-5,Edmunds,"So far loving the car ,the features, how it rides there is nothing I don‚Äôt like yet"
CX-5,Edmunds,I just know that there are different levels even in the grand touring which I was not made aware at the time of my purchase
CX-5,Edmunds,I loved my 2016 CX-5 GT so much that I had to get the new 2021 GT Reserve.  I got the Soul Red Crystal with the white interior and I couldn't appreciate more how fun this is to drive.
CX-5,Edmunds,"I looked at many cars before I chose the CX-5.  It had the best looking interior without going into the premium market.  There wasn't much hard, cheap plastic in the interior.  The dash wasn't overly busy like an airplane cockpit.  The mileage is good at 30.3/gallon.  I like the manual shift option which I use in the winter and hilly terrain.  The knocks are no heated review mirrors without going up the Grand Touring Trim.  At that time, the CX-3 offered heat rear view mirrors on the Touring trim.  Living in the Northeast, this is a safety feature for us.  The warranty is poor, 3 years/30,000 miles.  Other car brands are leaving this in the dust.  No CD player which almost all brands don't offer.  At that time, Suburu still offered it.  The long front snout makes it more difficult to judge distance.  In the end, my biggest disappointment is no heated rear view mirrors. This could have been added as an option in a package without paying an extra $2000 to go up into another trim for other stuff not needed."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Very slow and horrible fuel efficiency. The display is a joke. My Jetta that was two years old when I traded it was a joy ride compared to this boring,  inefficient,  slow and non intuitive piece of junk. Can‚Äôt wait for my lease to be over."
CX-5,Edmunds,"After the untimely demise of my previous vehicle, I rented a CX-5 and thought to test drive a CX-5 Signature.

First off, this car is very comfortable. Never before did I realize what I was missing without a heated steering wheel.

The ride is very comfortable and the turbo provides enough power to be taken seriously on the highway when merging or passing.

The entertainment system controls are knob controlled in the median area just set back from the gear shift.

All the fancy cameras and radars are also quite the upgrade.  This thing could probably park itself (but doesnt).

My only disappointment is the gas mileage; I get about 22 mpg, and it seems that 93 premium is recommended.

The AWD is a huge improvement in rainy conditions and I look forward to tackling any snow this winter."
CX-5,Edmunds,Never a Mazda or SUV fan but needed the AWD. Seats are leather but seem to be a bit hard. It is the GT model and it drives well although I do find it struggling to accelerate quickly and often seems lost between gears. Feels like the motor is winding while the transmission waits too long to up-shift. The infotainment system takes a little while to get used to because it is not a touch screen and I have a feeling the scroll wheel will be a point of failure at some time in the future. I personally don't like the way Mazda's look but it is growing on me. How could I buy a vehicle I don't find attractive? It has what I need and the price was right. I would highly suggest a turbo model.
CX-5,Edmunds,"Top notch SUV experience plus Mazda integrity,craftsmanship,and style. The best SUV I‚Äôve owned."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Was a little skeptical since we previously bought a CR-V and really liked it.  When we drove the CX-5 it really sold us.  Handled great and was fun to drive.  Can't really say that about the CR-V, which is a great car, but I wouldn't categorize it as ""fun"".  There was snow on the road when we drove the CX-5 and it had no issue.  Would have liked to get a 2022 but none available.  The dealer didn't charge over sticker like all the other dealers in Chicagoland so that was a huge advantage.  So far super happy with the vehicle."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Within 5 days of owning this car, the electrical system experienced a major malfunction. The steering went out, the brakes went out and the only thing that minimized the damage in the collision this malfunction caused was the automatic braking system. I brought the car to the dealership who has a Mazda technician come out and evaluate the vehicle. They said nothing was wrong. I paid an independent collision specialist to come run the cars system and they found a whole host of issues including bad sensors, faulty analog to digital transformers and missing grounds. To say I‚Äôm disappointed is an understatement. I traded it in and got a Tiguan. I don‚Äôt recommend Mazda. They‚Äôre trying to go up market with a down market price and you get what you pay for."
CX-5,Edmunds,Awesome ride and beautiful inside and out
CX-5,Edmunds,"My new 2021 Mazda CX-5 looks and feels like a luxury vehicle - for the price of a typical crossover suv.  Amazing look, feel, and entertainment system.  I leased my new car at Charlottesville Flow Mazda with the help of Ray Jordan.  He made my first time renting a car quick, easy, and fun.  The car is fantastic and I could not have found it without the help of amazing salesman Ray Jordan."
CX-5,Edmunds,"1-2 months ago I bought a CX5. A large part of my getting this SUV is because with my age and arthritis a car which is higher off the ground is easier to get in and out of than a sedan which is low to the ground. My decision was also based on my having read in Consumer Reports magazine that Mazda as a company was rated first place in their cars' reliability. Reviews in car magazines mentioned that the CX5's turbo-charger gives it a 0-60 mph time of about 6 seconds which pins me to the seat when I stomp on the accelerator in a highway entrance ramp. it also handles like it's glued to the road, which is in part a characteristic of the 4 wheel drive and the large tires. I have the top of the line ""signature"" model. It's heads up display is great and you can even alter the position of where on the lower windshield the display is projected - it can be moved vertically and horizontally. Another great option is that the accessory computer display is not a touch screen. My wife's car has a touch screen and I have to reach for it which takes my eyes off the road. The CX5's display is controlled by a 2.5 inch rotary knob which is just behind the gear-shift. That knob not only turns, but also tilts side to side, making selecting options easier than a touch screen. Right next to that knob is a small rotary knob which controls the radio's volume - pushing on it vertically turns the radio on or off. That display always shows the time. The doors lock automatically when the car reaches about 10 mph. There's two seat position memory buttons. The windshield wipers turn on automatically in the rain. The arm rest box has two USB-A outlets. The front seats can be heated or cooled. The steering wheel can be heated. The side rear view mirrors can be folded in and they also do so when you turn the car off. The center display can show you a 360 degree view, and automatically shows a front view when you're near something ahead like when I park in my home's garage it prevents me from running into the garbage pails. I'm not keen in the very large size of the key fob and its buttons are too small and are too easily pushed unintentionally, but it contains a conventional key inside of it, and you can easily replace the internal button battery. The headlights have an enormous lateral field of view. There's little room for an adult to fit in the back seats, but I bought the car as if it were a two seat car."
CX-5,Edmunds,"Nice little crossover. Comfortable, packed with tech & safety and stylish. I don't think it looks as good as an Acura RDX, but a similarly equipped RDX would have been close to $10K. For me, that just wasn't worth it. Turbo engine is nice and I am getting about 27 MPG, mostly highway. No complaints from me."
CX-5,Edmunds,I wanted the visual on the windshield
CX-5,Edmunds,Beautiful car inside & out!
CX-5,Edmunds,"The high tech features are a continuing irritation. Some I can turn off but the ""advanced keyless entry with push button start"" is a daily irritant. After opening the driver side front door and walking to the garage door, waiting for my wife to come out, the doors lock automatically. What a monumental irritant. I also don't like the large key fob that makes my key chain unwieldy (I will also need a new key fob battery every year) another nuisance. I also find the engine noisy under acceleration with transmission shift hesitancy and roar. It was a mistake buying this car. Not to mention the low fuel economy for a 2.5L engine."
CX-5,Edmunds,Great value
CX-5,Edmunds,I love everything about it !
CX-5,Edmunds,"I have the 2021 Grand Touring with the standard 2.5L.  White exterior with black leather.  This is our 4th CX-5 and is my favorite one so far.  The standard 2.5 has plenty of punch for me.  It is zippy around town and fun to drive with enough punch to get the job done on the highway.  I really like the cylinder cut-off feature.  With the display set to monitor the cylinder activation, it amazes me just how smoothly this car transitions from 4, to 2, to complete shut-off, and back to 4 cylinders.  It is seamless.  In my 2016 CX-5 the best I was able to get on the highway was about 32-33mpg.  In this 2021 with the cylinder cut-off I just completed two trips on the highway and achieved 39.6 mpg and 41.5 mpg.  This was a true measured calculation from fill-up to fill-up, with documented mileage.  The pump was always stopped at the auto cut-off on each fill-up.  I was extremely pleased with that performance.  This was achieved with the air conditioner turned off, windows up and cruise control set at no more then 5mph over the limit.  This engine really rewards you for smooth throttle input on the highway.  I could not be more pleased.

From our previous experience with the CX-5's, I know that the all wheel drive system is excellent on the road and I have always been pleased with the handling in light to moderate snowfalls here in PA.  The newer models have stepped things up in the safety department with many welcome features geared towards keeping you safer on the road.  Two thumbs up Mazda!!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"I'm very happy with my purchase even though at the moment MSRP is a deal.  This is my second CX-5, my first was a 2018 Grand Touring.  The 2021 has the upgraded screen which is a bit bigger and higher definition. Same styling as my older car but the Turbo edition gives me a bit more oomph as I get on the highway or need to pass another car without having to kick it into sport mode.  I would love to see wireless CarPlay in newer editions.  Plus a bumper guard and at this trim level a cargo mat and all weather mats would be nice too.  Otherwise the styling is on point and sexy. Love the lines of this car and believe you get a lot more in this class of car compared to the Honda, Toyota or Subaru.  The attention to detail in the inner cabin and the comfort level is far superior."
CX-5,Edmunds,Needed a new car do to Kia engine replacement which takes 3 months.  We had rented a cx5 over the summer.  It is the nicer model in this small suv line up.  The interior seems plush and refined compared to other models
CX-5,Edmunds,Comfortable
CX-5,Edmunds,I love my cx5.  This suv looks like a luxury car without the price.  I chose the crystal mica blue beautiful
CX-5,Edmunds,"My husband and I were looking for a size upgrade from my (purchased previous to meeting him) 2017 Honda HR-V. He's 6'3"", and let's just say it was a struggle.
I researched new vehicles online for a few months. Full disclosure- my list only included 0% financing offers. While I wanted to stay in an SUV, Mazda was running a special on the 6 at the time. Having never driven a car, I thought ""why not test drive it and see"". Side note- it was absolutely fabulous... but same problem, not a great fit for the hubby. We were on our way out when our salesman asked if we had looked at the CX-5. My first thought was ""nope, too much $, will not pay for financing""... but we took a look anyway and I sure did like what we saw. Now, we are not ""fancy"" people. I did not want leather/sunroof/bells/whistles/etc... just a solid, reliable, small SUV with enough cargo space for groceries and the occasional small furniture purchase. I was definitely interested in the newer safety features available, but thought they would not be an option without a high-level trim. I was wrong. One test drive in the CX-5 Touring and we were in love. Plenty of head/leg room, extraordinary amount of standard safety features, good gas mileage, luxurious interior, unique exterior styling, sturdy build, comfortable, and fun to drive... all at the right price point ($29k). Happy ending, we did get the 0% financing and the perfect compact SUV to fit our needs. Have had it for 4 months now and have no complaints. Definitely recommend!"
CX-5,Edmunds,Nice SUV easy to drive have a lot of space good technology
CX-5,Edmunds,Luxury without the luxury price tag
CX-5,Edmunds,"This car is awesome. We bought this compact suv as an upgrade from a small four door Chevy sedan. It‚Äôs large enough for an infant car seat, and can hold quite a bit with the seats laid flat. Loving this thing. It‚Äôs classy, reliable, attractive and a steal at $30k."
CX-5,Edmunds,So far (125 miles) so good.
CX-5,Edmunds,"I‚Äôm absolutely loving my cx-5, there are so many safety features and it‚Äôs purely luxury"
CX-5,Edmunds,"HIGHS: Power at all levels.Absolutely fun car to drive! The only car I ever owned that has the ideal seating position. Love the go-kart-like handling. Love the heated steering wheel and seats. The auto wipers and lights remove one more thing that takes your mind off of driving. Great sound. system
LOWS: Ugly wheels!!! The navigation system is too complex and primitive. Info system takes a long time to master-It still gives me fits. Could use more lighting at night on switches, some you can't see at all.50 more horsepower would make it a bomb!!!"
CX-5,Edmunds,"This car has been nothing but a joy to drive. The ride is smooth and the handling is on point. The interior is solid and doesn't feel cheap. The driver safety features really are helpful. At first I thought they would get annoying, but just yesterday I would have hit someone while switching lanes because he was completely in my blind spot. The warning beeped as soon as I put on my signal to change lanes!  The vehicle also has so much pick-up that I never use the optional ""sport"" accessory to boost speed. If I had to say one negative thing it would be that it's not awesome on gas. But I guess when you buy a Turbo that is to be expected."
CX-5,Edmunds,"The Mazda marriage with Toyota make this a contender. Good build well balanced drives well in city and down the highway. Long list of safety features standard.
The 2.5l SKYACTIV-G and 6speed trans are next to bullet proof 
The only 2 issues that keep this from being a 5 star pick is 
1) the keyfobs have the buttons on the edge and I often set off alarm/lock/unlock by just carrying keys in pocket
2) the Mazda Connect system is weak. No touch screen and a clumsy menu make this a frustrating feature. The only savior is Apple carplay and Android"
Forester,Edmunds,"Very comfortable, great head room, superb views from all windows. Substantial cargo area in hatch. Large glove compartment. Turn signals are not obnoxious, as most vehicles tend to be. Windshield and rear window wipers are large- sweep very well. Steering radius is fantastic!!!"
Forester,Edmunds,"I researched all the small and medium-size SUVs for a replacement for our 2016 Hyundai Tucson Eco and the Forester seemed the best choice. It broke our string of five no-problem Hyundais going back to 2000. The Forester delivers in all categories. It's roomy, economical and safe. The gas mileage is between 33-35 on the highway and 31-33 combined. It's about the same as the Tucson. A lot of magazines criticize the CVT transmission, but it's a welcome change from the dual-clutch in the Tucson which was really the only complaint. The Forester is more comfortable and has more cargo space. It's quiet on the highway and the full-time 4-wheel drive is fantastic in the rain. I love the car. Only complaint is that trying to figure out all the electronics is baffling. But, eventually, that will come around. One feature I don't like is that the engine shuts off when you stop in traffic for more than a few seconds. When you lift your foot off the brake, it sort of bangs back to life. There is a switch to override this function, but you have to turn it on every time you drive the car. There should be a permanent override or simply do away with this supposedly environmental function. We purchased the base model which had the wheel upgrade and interior rubber mat package. Our dealership was fantastic to work with and overall I feel we got a great deal."
Forester,Edmunds,"After 30 plus years driving Toyota vehicles I am a picky hard sell to change.  My dealership would not deal with me so I changed to Subaru with hopes of similar reliability.  My 2021 Forester limited has more options than a RAV4 limited and for over 3k less.  Standard AWD, comfortable ride and better mpg.  Just did a 300 mile weekend trip and the vehicle was great!  So far very happy with my first Subaru.
9/25/21 - not one issue with the new Forester.  Still rides quietly and solid with 3k miles.  I find the agile handling is confident and quick.  I like the eyesight auto cruise driving system to be very helpful for long drives.  In mostly city driving I‚Äôm averaging 24 mpg.  Great vehicle.

Odo reads 6k miles.  My Subie has been problem free.  Owning 3 previous Camrys I needed an suv that was comfortable and quiet.  The engine roars during hard starts but is still quieter than the RAV4.  Comfy drives and highway trips avg 31 mpg."
Forester,Edmunds,"We purchased this car to replace our 2007 Edge.  Was not sure if we were going to like it since it was not as heavy.  But after driving it, we Love it.  It is almost the same size as the Edge and has much better visibility.  It has plenty of pep with the Boxer 4 cylinder and do not have to deal with a turbo.  I like to do my own oil changes and this car has the oil filter sitting right up on top in the front with the threads down...so easy and no mess.  The transmission is sealed so I do not have to deal with the fluid.  We got the base model with a couple of upgrades....roof rack and 17 in alloy wheels.  There is still plenty of neat things on it without spending the extra money....unless you want them, which we did not.   All in all, the more I drive this car the more I like it."
Forester,Edmunds,"Just traded in my 2015 Subaru Outback 2015 Limited for a 2021 Forester Premium. I may have given up a teeny bit of luxury but I gained immensely in new safety features, those adaptive LED headlights and all that wonderful open interior and panoramic sunroof. I love that it is much shorter and narrower than the outback and it is a smooth wonderful ride.  Nice pick up. I am really enjoying my new Forester!!"
Forester,Edmunds,"Love the safety features especially the front & back eyesight driving.  Sure helps when backing out of busy parking lots!  It also alerts you of auto & pedestrian movement on the sides of your vehicle. Great safety feature!

Also for those that have difficulty driving in the dark, the headlights turn with the car so no blind spots on corners plus you can set the lights to bright & they will automatically dim when another vehicle is detected & then return to bright once it has passed.  

Alot to love about being a Subaru owner!"
Forester,Edmunds,"Picked up my 2021 Forester Touring on Saturday and wish I had looked at Subaru years ago.  A much better product than Honda.  Solid in every aspect - my prior 2019 CRV was all over the road in bad weather (snow, rain and wind).  Made the switch to go back to AWD and it is like night and day.  IMHO there is plenty of acceleration to get on and pass on the highway (was worried when reading reviews) but it has plenty of get up and go!  Comfortable and a pleasure to drive - went out on Sunday and drove over 150 miles and didn't realize it - did not want to get out of the car.  The only complaint - and it is MINOR - is the placement of the lap seat belt attachment.  Different placement and size compared to the Honda, but everything else is top of the line.  Lots of tech (if you want to use it).  As a long term Honda owner (owning the Pilot, CRV, Element and Odyssey) the Forester is hands down the best vehicle I have owned."
Forester,Edmunds,"So far this vehicle has proven to be every thing I read about it and even better on gas.  A lot of  electronics to learn, but nothing that really effects driving it. Great sound system. Subaru is one of the last cars to offer a cd player, which is part of why I bought it."
Forester,Edmunds,"So far, very pleased.  Very positive handling.  We have the Touring model, so it requires some skill to complete all the programming.  It took a while to trust the lane centering, but it really does a great job, as does the adaptive cruise control.  I was a bit concerned about the power after reading some other reviews, but I can say that the vehicle's power is more than adequate.  Quality of build is absolutely superior.  Can't fine one flaw anywhere in the interior or exterior of the vehicle.  That's the quick review."
Forester,Edmunds,"Traded in our 2016 Forester for the 2021 model and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Both models were the Premium line and there is so much more included in the 2021 over the 2016 that it is amazing. The ride is superior and so is the road noise (much quieter that is). Instrumentation and comfort is also much improved. So far couldn‚Äôt be happier. One thing to note is that because they put more into the car, you now have to purchase the cargo rails separately, but at $200 it was not the end of the world either."
Forester,Edmunds,"I'm a 6'2"" man with an unusually long torso. Most new vehicles come with standard moon roof, and no height control in the passenger seat. This means I do not fit in most new vehicles without special orders. Some of the only vehicles I fit comfortably in, with the trim levels I want, are the Forester (taller headroom) and Outback (standard option to delete moon roof). Luckily I love these cars.

I have a 2021 Forester Premium with the power lift gate package, which adds rear cross traffic alert. The safety is fantastic. Subaru's adaptive cruise control can follow start and stop traffic, or intelligently slow down if the car ahead slows. It can also automatically steer and change lanes, although the system requires a good amount of input. It cannot follow hard corners for instance. Android Auto means I can use my phone's Google Maps for navigation. The tech is quite good even on less-than-loaded models. Overall I think the Premium pack with power lift gate is open of the better options on the market.

It has buttons! I hate the Tesla style over reliance on touchscreens. They get dirty, and they're dangerous to use while driving. The Forester Premium has all the right controls (volume, climate) on physical buttons. Once you commit those controls to muscle memory it's a superior experience.

The engine rocks. Reviewers complain that the engine is smaller in class, while praising best in class fuel efficiency. The two are related. The Forester has similar EPA gas mileage to my old Civic (!), and feels if anything faster. It corners like a dream. My wife is not a performance driver and she is still commenting on the lack of body roll. The Forester comes standard with a CVT which maximizes fuel efficiency. Drivers used to harsh manual transmissions often feel CVTs are weaker because they don't jerk as much. Think of the Subaru boxer engine more like a luxury experience - the power delivery is immediately and smooth at all speeds. I spend 1/3 the amount on gas that my family spend for their Land Cruiser, yet this thing can probably race my old Civic, with similar gas mileage. It's insane.

It is also a Subaru in all the right ways. Tons of storage. I packed for 2 people for a week going cross country, and barely even used the back seat. We arrived at a muddy back road and engaged the X-Mode just for fun. The vehicle had zero issues and I arrived with more energy thanks to the excellent safety features and adaptive cruise control. Equally capable rock climbing as at highway speed.

Complaints? The ride is quite stiff. It feels fine on the highway, but over poorly maintained city streets where truckers have built up brake zone ruts it's like a roller coaster. The infotainment system could be faster and integrate more seamlessly with Android Auto. When I plug in my phone I want Google Maps - make it happen. The steering assist is a bit annoying. It requires such constant input that I don't feel I'm gaining much. However, up models (especially on the Outback) have even more advanced navigation that likely makes this better. The stop-start cruise control with engine cutoff for efficiency is still a winner, it's just not a Tesla autopilot. Storage could be better. The cup holders are far back to put the X-Mode button on display, and the console has fairly small bins, so you're often hunting for a spot to put things. It's not terrible, but you get the feeling if they relocated the X-Mode button you could gain the storage you need. Rear headroom is poor with the moon roof, so rear comfort is a bit of a budget experience compared to the front. Interior is worlds better than the last generation Subaru, but they still need a design expert to to get rid of those last vestiges of awful cheap plastic where your hands go (especially around the door handle, and around the shifter, for me personally).

Overall. Zero issues after a six-hour trip into mountains and dirt roads and mud. Dealership experience was ideal. Fuel consumption is beautiful. Subaru cruise control means you arrive at your destination fresher. Covid financing and warranty options mean I'll be seeing my dealer if anything happens, and right now that seems wonderful. This car makes me and my wife happy. We literally drove it from the lot to a bike shop. Subaru lifestyle is real."
Forester,Edmunds,"For me, an SUV needs to have plenty of well-arranged space, a quiet and smooth ride, safety features, reliability and decent gas mileage. The 2021 Forester checks all the boxes. The Subaru Eye Sight system has to be one of the industry leaders, and has been improved even since my 2019 Subaru. I suspect some might feel that the car is under-powered, but merging onto the interstate is no problem, the fuel economy is much better than with a V6, and thi is an SUV, not a sports car"
Forester,Edmunds,"What a difference three years makes ! The 2021 Forester‚Äôs head and shoulders better than its‚Äô predecessor. Proximity key makes for easy access. With key on your person, put your hand in the handle, and the car unlocks ( done from the passenger side, unlocks all doors !). Rear hatch opens seamlessly, faster than the previous model, also has heavier duty struts. Once the hatch is open, there is now a second button that closes and locks all the doors. Interior is rugged, especially the tailgate area being covered with rubber.  Eyesight‚Äôs better than ever, but, lane centering option is very jerky. Another nuisance is having to turn off the engine shutdown feature, otherwise at each stop and resuming driving sequence, the engine restart is noticeable, but not to the point it jerks you around. Infotainment and Starlink are also upgraded. With the My Subaru app, you can start the car remotely, also being able set temperature and other settings."
Forester,Edmunds,"I pretty much like this car. A couple of things that are irritating is the cup holder. It's too far back to easily get a bottle of water or cup, takes a bit of manipulating to get it in your hand. The seat belt clasp is much too close to the seat, it digs into my hip, and I'm not a heavy person. I stuck a wadded up rag between the seat and the clasp, it kind of works. Have to turn off the button that makes the car stop/turn on when you stop, and turned off the steering that helps keep you in-between lines, I felt I was fighting the steering wheel all the time. But most of all it seems the brakes sticks when in slow traffic, I lift my foot and it's still slowing then it releases and kind of surges a bit."
Forester,Edmunds,"I am absolutely in love with my 21 Forester Sport after 1 month and 900miles, it brings a smile to my face every time I drive it. I disagree with what is said in this review. I have been a die hard Toyota fan and a sports car guy, once I started to have a family I needed a change, and I couldn't be more impressed. This SUV accelerates and handles well. Is it going to throw you back? No, but what do you expect from a 4cyl N/A motor? I'd take it over a 4cyl Camry any day and I honestly have almost as much fun driving it as some of my previous sports cars, and it sticks in the corners on twisty, back roads."
Forester,Edmunds,"After years of Hondas and Toyotas and the poor treatment from the Toyota Dealership where I had purchased 7 Toyotas it was time to find different. During the pandemic I had lots of time to do online research and narrowed my choice to the Ford Bronco Sport or the Subaru Forester. The test drive and the style made the Forester my choice. We had two Toyotas to trade, A 2015 and a 2016 as it was time to go to one vehicle. The local Subaru dealer gave us $29,000 for the Toyotas and took $4,000 off the MSRP of the 2021 Forester Touring plus the 0% financing for 36 months made a great deal. The ride is great, the boxer engine is smoother than any V-8 we have owned also no torque steer when you accelerate. Visibility is very good and this is the first vehicle we have owned that I can see the end of the hood in many years. Very easy to get in or out of and the seats are great. The auto start/stop of the engine is annoying.`"
Forester,Edmunds,"This is my second Forrester, following my original first Subaru which was an Outback and a 2017 Forrester  - the Forrester‚Äôs windows‚Äô visibility range is my favorite feature, and its handling of corners and curves In the toughest weather is the best!  Subaru‚Äôs mechanical reliability over years of ownership has been outstanding as has their Service Dept. team.  Safety features and interior comfort are wonderful - I love my Subarus!"
Forester,Edmunds,I have one issue. It wants to be the boss of me. I object to the can telling me to keep my eyes on the road. I need to disable that feature. Otherwise I have no issues yet.
Forester,Edmunds,We are very happy with our purchase. It has great safety and comfort features that we were looking for. Consumer Reports rates it as the best overall compact SUV.
Forester,Edmunds,"Nice, Spacious, good handling and comfortable ride."
Forester,Edmunds,"This car is not a high performance vehicle and won't impress your friends at the country club but it will be safe, reliable, comfortable, efficient and cost effective. I had a 2019 and when I had the chance to trade up a couple of model years I didn't hesitate. I bought exactly the same model and build out as my original Forester. Because I liked it so much. My local dealer has a great reputation for service. The cargo space of the Forester is huge once you fold done the back seats. The eyesight feature enhances safety and the overall fit and finish is better than some of the German luxury cars I've owned in the past. If you are rational and logical and not looking for a status symbol it would hard to go wrong with the Forester. Never had a problem on the 2019 and don't expect I will on the 2021. Just....happy."
Forester,Edmunds,My girlfriend had a Subaru Forester and it went to the land Beyond and we had to replace it. We decided to stick with the new 2021 Foresters and we are very pleased. Obviously we had a lot of trouble due to microchip shortages and Coronavirus issues. But overall I'm sticking with Forrester for life.
Forester,Edmunds,"I love my Forester, I bought the Touring trim, as I currently drive a Lexus ES 350, and am accustomed to quite a few amenities. This vehicle has everything my Lexus has and more."
Forester,Edmunds,I always stayed with Lexus and Acura cars.This is my first Subaru Forester and so far I love the car. Over-all it drives vary nice and no complaints whatsoever.
Forester,Edmunds,Worth the purchase. Great safety features without spending a lot for an suv
Forester,Edmunds,This car has everything you could possibly want in a well appointed vehicle. It is by far my favorite vehicle I have ever driven. I look forward to many years of service with my Forester.
Forester,Edmunds,"I‚Äôve driven Mercedes-Benz sedans for most of the last 20 years and while my wife has owned SUVs most of the that time, I never really cared for them.  Lately I‚Äôve had lower back problems and came to the simple realization that my wife‚Äôs car was much easier to get in and out of than my own.

I bought the base model 2021 Forester with the wheel package and while this is definitely no luxury car (not even close), it isn‚Äôt annoying or uncomfortable.  Everything about it is simply adequate.  It is smooth and quiet on the freeway, though wind noise intrudes above 80 MPH or on windy days.  It is adequately powerful, though not in any way fast.  It gets adequate fuel economy (30MPG at 80 MPH, though still breaking in and may improve).  It even handles adequately, with a safe and secure feeling, tight turning radius and only moderate body lean, though of course there is nothing sporty about the handling.

In short, this car is an appliance.  Like my washing machine or coffee maker, it goes about its business without any annoyances, and of course with it‚Äôs high seating position it is even easier to get in and out of than my wife‚Äôs Mercedes GLC300, let along the Mercedes E300 I traded for it.

Speaking of trade, my regular Mercedes dealer of the last 15 years also carries Subaru in the shop next door, so even with the pandemic and microchip shortage, they gave me the new car at a slight discount (everywhere else was marking up new AND used cars a few thousand dollars over sticker) and matched CARMAX‚Äôs very high trade-in value on my E300.  In the end, I ended up with an even trade for my 80,000 mile old 2018 E300 for a brand new Forester and just paid the tax.

Its no luxury car, but so far (1000 miles in one weekend) it is a smooth, comfortable and solid-feeling car that I expect to give me years of trouble-free driving."
Forester,Edmunds,This is my second Forester and I'm lovin' it!  Visibility is the best.  Great handling on the road.  Takes corners on a dime.  Comfort and room abound!  We have more features this time around and it just adds to our pleasure driving and touring with this car!  I'm guessing I'll make a return in three years for yet another Forester.
Forester,Edmunds,"Very attractive vehicle, excellent handling, our Foresters go everywhere in all weather conditions - especially snow that hobbles other vehicles. Rear automatic braking and rear cross traffic safety features, along with blind spot detection make this a much safer vehicle."
Forester,Edmunds,"Just bought this car this week.  Very impressed-t is such a smooth ride, especially on rough farm backroads.  Much more comfortable than the 2017 ford edge titanium i traded in.  Engine has plenty of getup and go.  BIGGEST COMPLAINT:  the harmon carden stereo does not accept iphones.  I am now understanding it is owner by samsung and people with apple iphones are having a ton of problems with the music skipping and being very distorted.  I did not know this before i bought the car and i probably wouldnt have bought it because i am an apple person.  Apparently all of the updates to both phone and car are not fixing it. I read about problems since 2018.  Huge disappointment for such a great car."
Forester,Edmunds,"Very practical and capable suv, a workhorse"
Forester,Edmunds,Very surprised at the level of features and styling. First new car in 20 years and we made the right choice.
Forester,Edmunds,The car is not as quiet as most new cars while driving it but it is very comfortable to ride in.
Forester,Edmunds,It's a smooth ride with a lot of standard features and comes with AWD. Plus plenty of rear leg room. All and all a real good ride and ride
Forester,Edmunds,"roomy, comfortable, tight turning radius. love this car"
Forester,Edmunds,"Have always had ‚Äúother‚Äù vehicles and dedication to the brands.  Decided we wanted something with a track record that had high marks in safety and longevity on the road and everything pointed towards Subaru.  Dealership was AMAZING and helpful with narrowing down which model would best suit us and going over every single option and package in detail and even laying out all the pricing options in front of us so we could compare easily and consider which would work best for us.  Planet Subaru in Hanover, MA ... can‚Äôt say enough good about them!  Definitely the ‚Äúun-dealership‚Äù that they touted... great experience any great product!"
Forester,Edmunds,"3 Subarus in three years due to quality issues....this 2021 Forester, my sixth, has the worst ride quality ever...ok on highways,  but around town you're thrown all around. Road noise is terrible, on wet roads sounds like no insulation. 20019 Legacy had body assembly issues . Dealer ripped me off  $7500 trade difference on a 2020 Forester, So much for best trade-in value.2021 windshield broke. Dealer said call you insurance co. I got on customer service any finally got it replaced. Seems having a issue with windshields breaking."
Forester,Edmunds,Positively hate the ESS. The car shakes and shudders every  time when stopped at the red light and shakes and shudders again when it restarts.Keep switching it off but  it goes back into that mode as soon as I turn it on.
Forester,Edmunds,"2021 Forester Touring for about a week now.  First the positives.  The stereo system blows away the Bose I had in Acadia.  Very responsive steering.  Mileage good. Smooth ride.  Now negatives.  Gas tank access on passenger side.  If the car doesn't have ventilated seats then why the perforations in the seats?  Feel sorry for the kid who pukes and you have to clean out  the holes. Eventually the holes stretch and don't look good plus they fill up with dirt, dust, dead skin, food crumbs.  Take a look on youtube as to how to clean.  Hole by hole with a dental tool.  Subaru has a head up or head straight ahead system which is actually kinda cool BUT if they were so concerned about keeping your eyes on the road then why not a heads up display on the inside windshield?  Where I have the steering wheel it blocks a portion of the dash and I need to look down.  Then get a warning to keep my head up.  Overall a decent vehicle but seems like not much thought went into the design.  Give it 3.5 out of 5 stars as of today."
Forester,Edmunds,"I got my Forester sport in June 2021. First impression was great. After using the car for a week I started noticing many quality issues:
1- Engine noise is not good
2- interior noise such as plastic cracking and stuff moving that you can't find
3- Mpg is never honest after driving for 4 months I only got 22MPG combined not even closed to what it was advertised for.
4- Some mechanical noise stuff moving outside the car under the engine when you drive on a rough dirt road.
5- Not comfortable driver seat. If drive for a long distance you will for sure get back pain from setting into that uncomfortable driver seat or the passenger seat.
6- Eyesight system is never good when you enter a tunnel or driving in the city. It immediately stop and you almost lose control of the vehicle. Almost got me in a deadly accident + Adaptive Cruse control will not detect car who just pulled in front of you and you will need to stay alert all the time.
7- Engine power is like dragging a dead body. All sound but no power 
8- Towing capacity is just 1500lb and you need to pay around 1k to install a good hitch that looks like a factory install and for what to add a bike rack!
9- Wind noise makes you feel that you are riding a bicycle
10- Sound system quality is bad 
11- water leaks inside the door panel after car watch which could damage your speakers.

Overall I wish I did some research and no got fooled by the look of the car.
It's very disappointing to see that Subaru being advertised as a luxury safe while in many areas they have failed. Quality control team can do better special on the interior noise and the engine HP maybe STI brand can put their hands on Forester and show us what the real Forester will look like."
Forester,Edmunds,So far we love everything about this vehicle!
Forester,Edmunds,"Purchased a brand new 2021 mid-level Forester and so far, have regretted the decision.  This car is clearly aimed at folks my age (mid 50's) who more than anything are considered ""immigrants to technology"" but now are driving a vehicle loaded with tech that borders more of an autonomous experience.  
I can't tell you how many times my poor dog has been nearly launched through the front windshield as the ""eyesight"" feature detects a car slowing/stopped in front of me and slams on the brakes.  So far, this has not happened on an icy road but when it does, we will end up either in the rear-end of the car in front of us or sliding into oncoming traffic.
During highway travel, the car takes over, (especially with the cruise control feature activated) slowing us down and correcting if I get too close to the fog lines.  
And God forbid you don't want to wear you seat belt or take it off too early, you're treated to the ascending warning chime which makes you want to poke out your eyeballs hoping it will stop. 
Too much happening on the dash as far as lights activating telling you something, taking your eyes off of the road.  
The tiny graphics imprinted on the steering wheel buttons are not good for those who we
glasses and have to look down at them for several seconds to see exactly which button they just pressed.  
Having recurring issues with the bluetooth system dropping calls.
If I can speak for those in my generation, this is just too much tech and too frustrating of a driving experience.  
The car is not a total loss, however-  I love the engine, full-time awd, and the spacious interior.  Another totally cool touch employed by Subaru is providing something the equivalent of after-market all weather mats for the front back and cargo area as standard."
Forester,Edmunds,Very spacious and a smooth drive.
Forester,Edmunds,"Everything about this car is great! I love that I can see well out of all the windows and, when I can‚Äôt, the eyesight tells me who is in my blind spot. It makes me feel very safe."
Forester,Edmunds,"Roomy, responsive, great safety  features,quiet on the highway."
Forester,Edmunds,"SuriusXM and starling, cost monthly fees after free trial. Otherwise, I‚Äôm enjoying all the features on this car."
Forester,Edmunds,"Rented for a week. The electronic features like the operation of the key FOB, climate controls, lane departure, cruise control, etc., were maddeningly difficult to figure out.  Ride was fairly smooth but with 1980's compact car levels of road and engine noise.  Acceleration was good.  

The only inexpensive small SUV I've rented that has had car like levels of ride comfort, interior noise and seat comfort is the Korean based Buick Encore. But it's a smaller vehicle than the Forester & Rav4."
Forester,Edmunds,We just didn't like a feature about the car stops hen at stoplights or stop sign and it took some time to starts back up. All Subaru vehicles have this feature.
Forester,Edmunds,"Not that impressed, suspension a bit soft and so many rattles. Three piece dash? Subaru scolded me for wanting the eyesight unit to be fixed because it rattles! I was pissed, they made me feel so small....Great Mpg at the cost of light weight. and squeaks? Also design of wheel arches with 18 rims looks cheap, off the ground with small wheels."
Forester,Edmunds,"After more than 30 years of driving on different car brands. Subaru Forester is the best of the best.
we are extremely  happy with everything they build in the car. except the start/Stop option. That is the only dislike and annoying figure that I have . -- Safety, comfort are Top notch --
I wish I know it long ago. Remember: No car is perfect. But this one is standing out as the best !.
I recommend:  Do a lot of test drives on others to compare with it. You will buy it .
Need not to word it long here.
I give it a 5 stars all across with a big thumb up .The best bang  for your bucks."
Forester,Edmunds,"I love these new features like automatic lights on/off, auto high/low beam, steering response headlights, off-line warnings, auto dimming mirrors both inside and outside. Excellent visibility all around the car. All these features make it so easy and nice to drive."
Forester,Edmunds,"Edmunds review is right on the mark. I had to sell due to the noise, power, and tech deficiencies at  3150 miles. Purchased a 2022 Hyundai  Santa Cruz :)
My 1st Subaru and I really thought I liked the 21 Forester Sport . The LED head/fog lights and  AWD are 5 stars ,Got a great deal on the Sport w/ power lift gate, premium sound and  0% financing.  I kayak and cycle , so there's lots of space for my gear inside.  I should have rented it 1st before purchasing. The BAD: The start/stop is random/annoying, MPG avg is 22, ride is stiff/bumpy but ok, engine/power/trans are ok, the premium stereo covers the noise, the 3 screens were cool at 1st but they are a distraction. Starlink, Eyesight seems to work ok. The tech stuff is just not put together well, too many buttons, distractions, and sometimes buggy. The manuals are a bit huge. The roof rack is a problem, the factory  rails/crossbars work with my kayaks but not my bikes. I purchased a Thule and Yakima roof rack for my bikes and they caused too much wind noise. So I had to return those. I found a Malone brand Roof Rack that attached to the roof rails and it hold my bikes with less wind noise. I have to remove the rack when I want to transport my kayaks. Washing is a chore because  mud and dirt get in between all 5 doors/seals/frame and it makes it harder to clean.  I think Subaru needs to refine the Forester design and improve the drivers experience. Overall it's  an OK vehicle. I guess I don't love the quirks of my ""Foz"". My pet's don't drive and it's not an option to turn it in to a dog house. I guess I'll have sell it soon."
Forester,Edmunds,"I planned on buying a new 2022 Forester. But after test driving 2021 the engine is very underpowered, very noisy (I know it's a boxer engine), and leans too much going around corners. My wife has a CRV and it is much quieter, handles better and much more refined.  Also, Windshield cracking issues...I will give the Forester a plus for off road handling and that's it.  No thanks I will pass."
Forester,Edmunds,"My work has been purchasing a fleet of these for our work cars. It‚Äôs the single worst car I have ever driven in my life. It not only goes no where when you put the foot down it‚Äôs a death trap. It decides to slam the breaks on for no reason, example man hole that was 20mm high from the road slams breaks on. It beeps at you constantly, don‚Äôt dare look out your side window it‚Äôll tell you by beeping at you  

I would rather ride a unicycle at work than this POS"
Forester,Edmunds,"If you do not have a degree in either electrical engineering or computer science you, too, will hate this car. They have dumped a zillion burdensome technologies into it, and it will take the aforesaid degrees to disable them. Run, run away from this car!"
Forester,Edmunds,Rides smooth
Forester,Edmunds,I am overall happy with my Forester. I bought the premium package but did not realize that the back up camera did not beep on the premium package. Salesman did not mention that. Rather disappointing but a very nice vehicle.
Forester,Edmunds,The supposed safety features actually create too much distraction & the car insists on telling you how to drive‚Ä¶more distraction. I loved my 2018!!  This is a death trap!!
Forester,Edmunds,loaded with safety features
Forester,Edmunds,AWESOME SUV!!!
Forester,Edmunds,"Waiting to get best price, too many ways to change MSRP."
Forester,Edmunds,Best car on the road‚ù£
Forester,Edmunds,Our Subaru Forester touring edition is six months old to date it seems to be really solid dependable car seems a little basic for height and model in terms of comfort and quiet ride
Forester,Edmunds,Great little car
Forester,Edmunds,"Got over 35 mpg on last 400 plus mile trip on the 101 Loop highway with some back road gravel driving. Seats are uncomfortable for 6' 3"" 250lb guy or I would have given it 5 stars."
Forester,Edmunds,"I've been driving since 1971 and this is my first SUV vehicle and the 2021 Subaru Forester in premium trim has that honor.  Delivered in October 2021 amid the chip shortage, we lucked out because the person above us on the wait list declined when the vehicle arrived and with our choice of Jasper Green and Premium trim being the one that arrived, how could we refuse.  So far our ""Suba"" has not let us down, able to carry anything we have asked it to, including 5 cat cages!  The engine to us has given good response and decent mileage, considering our home area is traffic congested Honolulu.  So I can only imagine when folks on the ""mainland"" drive from state to state, maybe thats when people will appreciate more power, but to me the 2.5 engine is just fine.  Love the LED headlights, you will never want to go back to halogen after this!  Love the moonroof, AC vents for the rear passengers and having the rear seats recline is a bonus and the safety systems are top notch, especially the blind spot monitoring and rear traffic alert which added a power lift gate.  Wife and I are very pleased with our first Subaru!"
RAV4,Edmunds,"We have purchased several Toyota's over the years. All of them have given us great service. Our latest a 2021 XLE has taken the shine off that impression. We hear whistling noises at highway speeds, the engine is much noisier then previous generation and the transmission is also not as enjoyable. Interior sort of jumps back to a more sterile and cheaper finish. I guess everything is still providing a decent experience just not what I have come to expect from past Toyota's."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I think they‚Äôre actually may be a safety issue with the 2021 RAV4, I have been trying to get in contact with Toyota and it‚Äôs almost impossible.

When I drive starting around 60 to 65 mph, the car gets really shaky and bumpy and feels unstable. I am now noticing this reflected in a few other reviews and I‚Äôm starting to think that there actually may be an issue with this exact model"
RAV4,Edmunds,"Yesterday we took the RAV4 on a long distance drive to checkout the features. I like the road sign and lane sway warning feature however we observed the car was swaying and appeared to be difficult to control while traveling around 65-75 mph when LTA and Cruise Control were on. I did not use cruise control during the remainder of the trip.

This seems to be a known issue .. too bad we did not see this issue when we checked out the numerous video reviews on Youtube ......

RAV4,Edmunds,"I have owned so many cars in my lifetime but never a Toyota. I have bought used cars, cars that were just junk and I have bought new cars and most of them have let me down and failed prematurely. My background in the Military required an immense ability for attention to detail and trust me when I say that when something wasn't right with my vehicle, I knew it. Everything from the steering, to braking, to subtle noises and even distinctive smells that should not be coming from under my engine compartment that certainly hinted at trouble to come.
That being said, I can honestly say that I was thoroughly impressed with the workmanship and quality that was noticeable immediately when inspecting the exterior and interior of my new Rav4. You can feel it when you are driving in the response of the vehicle the way it handles, the way the steering feels in your hands and the purr of the motor you feel under your feet. You just get the sense that this car is going to last and is a worthy investment of safety and peace of mind. If you are considering a Rav4...don't even hesitate...go drive one and I am willing to bet, you will buy it. They are truly amazing vehicles."
RAV4,Edmunds,The 2021 Rav4 very bumpy and shaky when driving over 55mph. The stability on the hwy is so poor and dangerous.  Very disappointed with Toyota safety design
RAV4,Edmunds,"I've always driven General Motors vehicles but in March 2021, I decided to give Toyota a chance after hearing wonderful things about the Rav4.  After having the car for less than one month, I was at a stop light - completely stopped - and my car lunged forward TWICE and hit the car in front of me.  While at the body shop, the technician was pulling the car around and had his foot on the brake and said the RMPs went up and the car lunged again.  I immediately reported it to Toyota after the first incident.  They sent someone to the body shop to perform diagnostic tests.  The test was completed on 4/14.  I reported the second incident on 4/27 (immediately after it was reported to me) and was told they could not do anything until the Toyota engineers review the diagnostic test data.  To sum it up, I have a brand new car that I have not driven since 4/1/21 because I do  not feel it is safe to drive.  Neither my salesman at Van York or Toyota have been of any assistance."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I was surprised by negative reviews of the 2021 RAV4.  I have had mine for a few months and have had no problems with it.  Often new cars have little issues at first, but this one has had none and I hope this continues.  I got the hybrid AWD model.  The gas mileage is amazing and it did really well in the snow.  Hopefully it continues to do well because I was planning to keep it for a very long time."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I love the easy ride and the power to go, go, go.  If I need to get on the freeway quickly, this car has the oomph to do it!  I love the color (silver) and all the bells and whistles.  I plan on keeping this car for a long time."
RAV4,Edmunds,"We recently purchased a 2021 RAV4 XLE PREMIUM trim for my husband. This SUV is amazing and comfortable, as he is 5‚Äô11 and I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù. The 2.5L engine has a lot of pick me up when needed, which I don‚Äôt understand how some are saying this vehicle is underpowered, sure it‚Äôs no 8cylinder but it has more than sufficient power for everyday use. It‚Äôs very roomy, much more than my new 2021 NX 300 makes me like the RAV4 a little more since it‚Äôs also very reasonable in price with all the features it brings. We bought ours with just the features the XLE Premium has to offer with no extra add ons, since this is a commuter vehicle and my husband drives 92 miles a day round trip and a full tank of gas lasts a little over 4 days. That‚Äôs amazing for it being a gasoline engine and not a hybrid, which we tend to stay away from for now until that technology is a little more perfected. Overall I definitely recommend this trim level RAV4, oh and it‚Äôs assembled in Canada which I know from experience produces amazing quality Toyota models. Test drive one for yourself! We traded in our reliable 2017 Camry SE for this one and don‚Äôt regret it one bit! We are a Toyota family for life!!!! 

Update as of 10/05/2021 - We are still in love with our RAV4 and it‚Äôs been very reliable after 12,000 miles. Only been at Toyota for regular service and get its oil changed every 5k instead of the 10k for extra protection to the engine. I still highly recommend this vehicle for anyone in the market for a reliable and spacious SUV that gets great gas mileage!"
RAV4,Edmunds,"Went on road trip, driving about 80 mph on highway. Big 18 wheeler goes by on right side fine.  A Ford pickup F150 goes by on right side I feel like I got sucked in. Was fighting driving the SUV all the way. And coming back a Mustang goes by on right and the same. Held real tight to the steering wheel and I felt that it was all over the road too. Engine is loud too.  Has anyone else feel this way?  I read some reviews and can't find them.  Getting it checked..."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I hate the sound this years Rav makes when it first excels. It sounds like a truck straining. I loved my other 2 Ravs , neither sounded like this. I wish it was quieter.  Once in an SUV , I don‚Äôt want to go back to a car. I hope they change the way it sounds when you start off. My husband also finds it‚Äôs tight getting in passenger side without hitting your head ."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I bought this car for my wife. She drove it 2 months and gave it to me. I have driven it for 2 years and I want to give it back to her. Let me tell you the good things first. It‚Äôs reliable because it‚Äôs a Toyota. It averages 27mpg. Cargo space is useful. It‚Äôs cool looking. It‚Äôs easy to park. Acceleration is impressive for such a small engine. The bad- cabin is small and cramped. I hit my head when climbing in. The door sill is raised and I catch my foot on it exiting vehicle. Wife doesn‚Äôt have a flat surface to place purse on. Doors have no grab point to hold onto and avoid bashing car door on neighbors car you park next to. Interior lighting is poor, can‚Äôt see fuel door release in the dark. Engine sounds like a wheat thrasher about to explode under hard acceleration. Car is jittery on the highway and dances in the lane. Very difficult to keep it steering in a straight line without correcting constantly. Low pressure tire light comes on but fails to indicate which tire might be low. Does not have any way to monitor mileage for next service due. SImply comes on when due. Car has various annoying rattles. As soon as the new Frontier arrives, this car will be someone else‚Äôs baby. NO GIVEBACKS!"
RAV4,Edmunds,"Pro:
*Fantastic new D4S generation of engine.
*Attractive exterior styling.
*Updated interior ergonomic and technology.
*Same useful utility. 

Cons:
-Vague steering.  In fact its night and day worse compare to the previous generation of 2018.
-Inferior lumbar support on drivers seat which is painfully noticeable on long trips."
RAV4,Edmunds,I have just purchased a 2021 Toyota Rav 4 Hybrid and am impressed by the fit and finish.. But that's the end of it... The road noise is way beyond acceptable.I wear hearing aids and have to remove them when driving just to make the noise more bearable.. I recently owned a Ford Edge and it was completely sound proof and a pleasure to drive... This vehicle is going up for sale after just 300 kms of driving... I can't live with this noise any longer... Toyota should know better and should spend some dollars on sound proofing this vehicle ...
RAV4,Edmunds,"I'm 62 years old and this was to be my retirement vehicle. I used to be a toyota loyalist. Although I have been driving a buick for 10 years. Had a 2003 Rav4. Drove it for 8 years until totaled in accident. I guess I'm too old now.  Decided to be economical and buy the New Rav4. Wrong. Way too much noise. Road and wind noise.  Engine noise is awful. Steering bad. Never had issues with cloth seats before. This model is terrible.  Soils so easily. Just touch it with anything. Then when I try to clean it.  It makes water rings. The seats are hard and thin and uncomfortable.  My husband complained about lighting. He's correct. Awful. Very little wimpy interior lights.  WHY ?  And back to seats. No height adjustment for passenger seat! Really they couldn't put the little hand crank to raise or lower.  The sun visors are too small and without raising the seat everytime you are blinded. Everything is hard plastic touches. No comfort.  To use the buttons on lower left you have to twist and lower your head. Not good. Back doors do not open far enough. Other small suvs open all the way out. The touch screen is horrible to look at. Faded and harsh. Looks like terrible TV picture.  The radio speakers not good. Cheap sounding. Not clear. Toyota has the levels and packages crazy on this. To get the better features it is way pricey. You can go ahead and get a midsize suv. Which is exactly what I did. But couldn't get Toyota sadly. Way too pricey. Sadly had to get another foreign maker.  Midsize with luxury features. But all the sharp sporty looks. The new 2021 Kia Sorento. LOVE! 
The Rav4 is sharp looking but it ends there. Just my opinion. I really hate it. I wanted to love it! 
Transmission jerks all the time. Stop start jerks....the cluster gauge is tiny. Hard to read so much on there! Try other comparable vehicles. Lost money because we had to get rid of it"
RAV4,Edmunds,"i am surprise at negitive reviews, I am happy with my rav4.  It gets great gas mileage, I am getting 30 mpg combined and after breakin I am expecting alittle better.   I do agree the seats are firm but I have had back surgery and it really isnt a problem for me.  I find the cabin to be super quiet and I do not hear engine noise on the highway.  It is a small suv and I do not expect a Lexus performance.  I am happy with my purchase.  I owned a CRV and had issues with it.  I am hoping that toyota comes through for me with a great reliable suv."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I have had this RAV4 for a year now.  It is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  This RAV4 replaced a 2010 CRV EXL that I had for over 10 years.  It was a great, reliable vehicle, but this RAV4 way out performs the CRV.  But then this is newer technology also.  The RAV4 has more power, smoother ride with the 2.5L 4 cyl with the 8 speed auto trans (a great combination).  I get great gas mileage, between 33 and 34 mpg on the highway, and between 28 to 29 around town.  I love the AWD and the 19"" wheels.  Being this is my first new vehicle in over 10 years, I love all the new technology and safety features that my old vehicle did not have.  You can get a laundry list of all the great features it has on the Toyota site, so no need to list them all here.  I realize that many new vehicles have similar new technology and safety features, but I really like the styling of the RAV4 and Toyota's reputation of quality and reliability.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this vehicle.  Being in the Detroit area, I am criticized for not buying one the 'Big 3' vehicles, but I don't work for them, and their quality and reliability can't compare to Toyota as far as I am concerned.  I will put far less money into maintenance with the Toyota and it will last far longer.  You cannot go wrong with this vehicle."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I completed considerable research prior to my purchase. I test drove the competitors. The Rav4 has the most horsepower (eliminating troublesome turbo options of other makes), best gas mileage, best clearance, most cargo space and the most reliable engines. The ride is smooth and quiet, acceleration is eager and responsive , great visibility, nice large touch screen and plenty of head and elbow room. I have not experienced any steering or road noise issues mentioned in other reviews. I do agree the lumbar support could be improved (but I could say the same for the competition). It's also the best looking SUV out there, IMHO. There is definitely a reason this SUV is the top seller in it's category, even though it's not the cheapest. I bought my Rav4 in April 2021 and I am super happy with my decision."
RAV4,Edmunds,The 2021 Rav4 is still leaking roof rail. It had bad gaskets on the roof rail bolts.
RAV4,Edmunds,"Pros: Smooth Ride, Decent acceleration, Relatively quiet highway driving, Good fit and finish, (finally) power seat on XLE model, Apple Car Play, comfortable seats.
Cons: Quirky 8 Speed transmission has trouble finding gear at slow speeds, minor occasional lurch in first gear from stop, noisy engine permeates cabin in city driving, RAV4 not quite as nice as 2018 and under years. Mazda CX-5 better vehicle. [non-permissible content removed]."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Pros: good gas mileage, dependable.  Cons: cheap interior rattles all the time, door color and dash color do not match, door controls are poorly positioned, door handle is not positioned well, underpowered, Android Auto/Apple car play has to be plugged in with wire while competitors offer wireless, lighting in the trunk area is non existent, lighting for center console does not point and the buttons are not lit so you do not know what you are pressing overhead, loud squeeling sounds come from engine compartment in reverse and when you are sitting still. I wish I had done more research before purchasing. I have previously owned 2 other Rav4s and they were built much better."
RAV4,Edmunds,"OK, just test drive a Toyota RAV4 mid-size or base version. Their interior is poor, below industry standard, seats uncomfortable and even front windows shudder when powered up/down. 
Toyota is the cheapest car company. Their arrogance on reliability has completely destroyed the fine design, completely disregarded consumer expectations of this 21st century! You don't have to believe my review. Just sit in RAV4 and you will see what I am stating here.
The entire top Management of Toyota needs to be fired. Just sit inside Honda CRV, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Outback etc. And then compare to the cheapest, rudest experience at $30-35K price level you get from Toyota."
RAV4,Edmunds,Vehicle is too lite for snow covered roads.  Looks nice but too many low price parts result in noisy ride and low quality feel.  The added safety features are nice but actual feel and ride are not impressive.  I would rate the feel and ride at 1 star.  Based on this over priced vehicle I would not recommend it over other market AWD.
RAV4,Edmunds,"I consider myself a Toyota client.  I have been driving Toyotas for years.  I have had a Yaris, Camry, and 2-previous RAV4.  Great decision on those previous cars, but with 2021 LE TAV4 it has been my worst decision on cars ever.
Exteriors look nice like all models.  Drivers chair VERY uncomfortable.  Motor VERY noisy, and you hear the car doing a lot of effort.  The actual car inside it is very noisy you don't have complete silence inside.  Speakers sound not good either. I hate driving this RAV4.  If you have this car in mind consider your decision this is a car and now I'm stuck until this lease is over."
RAV4,Edmunds,2021 Toyota RAV4 is meeting and exceeding all our expectations. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV of this size. It‚Äôs very versatile and comfortable. The Toyota app and Android Auto are fantastic tools.
RAV4,Edmunds,"We love this vehicle. We had an older 2012 Rav4 and liked it, but this one has so many improvements. Much better 4 wheel drive, more power. We highly recommend it."
RAV4,Edmunds,"We have only had the car a couple of weeks but drove it 1500 miles across the western US. It performed perfectly and was both comfortable and well equipped. The gas mileage did however average only 27 MPG with only two adult passengers and a moderate amount of luggage, but that is likely because we were consistently driving at highway speeds across expanses of desert.  Very pleased so far, though early days."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Rented a RAV4 XLE AWD while visiting my sister. Found the vehicle to be comfortable, with excellent seating position, much better than my current car. Excellent visibility and lane changing alert worked well. Engine somewhat underpowered from stop, but gets up to speed quickly. 
I own a Subaru Outback, and the RAV4 definitely has a more truck like feel. Not that it‚Äôs bad, just different. A bit of road noise at highway speed and a whine at acceleration which should have been engineered better. 
‚ÄúA‚Äù pillar does lean back a bit low, so definitely a consideration if you are taller to get in and out of vehicle. Interior door handle is close to hinge, as others noted, but didnt really have any difficulty with its use. Radio intuitive, actually simple. Loved ‚ÄúCar Play‚Äù which displayed my phone‚Äôs GPS on screen. 
Overall a solid vehicle, with minimal complaint."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Great suv love every aspect, mine is a 2021 i don't have battery or gas tank issues. One thing about buying new cars stay away the first 2 years or production take goes on any car. Only wish they had 4x4 instead of AWD."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I have a new 2021 Rav4 XLE Premium. When I release the brake the vehicle stumbles or jerks or lurches, whichever term you prefer. I have just over 1,000 kms on it and my service manager says that there is no software or mechanical fix for the issue."
RAV4,Edmunds,I had a 2017 Toyota Camry but wanted something bigger. I wanted to love the RAV4 but was disappointed in the power. It felt like it was struggling to get up to speed and to maintain. Unfortunately all of the RAV4s have the same engine too which is disappointing with No option to upgrade. I would much rather get a little less gas mileage and get more horse power to make it feel adequate. I ended up going with a used 2018 V6 Tacoma.  The 4 cylinder Tacoma was underpowered too. I did like everything else about the Rav4 from test driving.  Hope this helps anyone in the market.
RAV4,Edmunds,"A new 2021 RAV4 XLE (gas) is sitting in my garage. It seem nice. Doors could shut easier. There is a tendancy for them to reman open a crack if you don't push hard to shut. The gas mileage is short of the published numbers, and the tank is small (14.5 gallons, which is the redesigned tank for the hybrid version). There is a full size 12v battery, so therre should be enough juice to power the various options and accessoriers without going dead overnight. The car hopefully has the service fix for that issue experienced with the 2020s.  It's a lot of car for the money. Buyers should do their research to know what to expect."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Door handle on the inside is too close to the door hinge, make it very hard to close. 
Lack of power and seat comfort. Rear tail gate hinges are made of very cheap material appears to be cracking after 1 year. 
The only thing I like about it is the modern interior design. 
The Subaru, Santa Fe and the Sorenta are better design and value."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Gas in oil crankcase, loud road noise, rear seats don't fold flat, under powered, not happy with my 2021 toyota rav4..."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I got the XLE hybrid for my wife who was set on this car. I would not have bought this. This is a very nice looking car but it lacks in almost every way compared to my 15 year old Audi.

The road noise is bad. Like really bad. It is as if somebody has a hair dryer on in the back.

The road noise cannot be even mitigated with music because the speakers are of very poor quality. The music is not crisp at all. I have never heard such low quality sound in a car. Its comparable to listening on the speaker of your phone.

Speaking of phones and music. That is the only way to get music into the car. There is no CD player. There is no auxiliary audio in. You have to do everything through your phone. This is not the terrible but it is super annoying and limiting. Just another cheap out from Toyota.

In terms of driving it does not handle well. I likely should have gone for the XSE which has higher end suspension in it. The XLE sways around corners and generally feels like it needs new shocks. 

The view is not great either. They compensate for it by having a ton on sensors but it would just be better if the layout was designed properly.

In summary this is not really a high end SUV. This is a soccer mom car for getting groceries not for ski trips. Generally feels cheap."
RAV4,Edmunds,"'21 RAV4 base line is hum drum.  Whiny engine (underpowered) and aside from std safety items, isn't nicely equipped.  The Limited trim, on the other hand is nicely equipped but way too expensive.  However, balancing options and staying out of the luxury brands, the Limited is a good balance on options and price.  Very well equipped (a/c vented front seats, pano moonroof, 360 birds eye camera system,...) Limited priced at $36K ($4k under MSRP).  Gas mileage is a joke!  RAV4 window sticker says 33mpg on the highway...  we average 22-24mpg...  Honda CRV does get 29-31...  As for driving experience, the struts on RAV4 is stiffer than CRV, but all round driving is sub par to CRV.  Lane assist operates sometimes well, but on the honda, works great.  Auto tailgate works sometimes...  adaptive cruise sometimes...  Yes, all round the Honda wins...  but if you drive a lot and really need vented front seats, the RAV4 is the only model with it.  RDX ASPEC and Advanced ($47K) has it..."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Stay clear of the entry models. Tire noise is terribly loud (while there isn't much wind noise, the sound of the tires rolling is overpowering). The ride is quite harsh and the suspension doesn't do a good job of soaking up bumps.

The seating position is also not good. You feel like you're almost touching the ground and the dashboard is very high (not ideal for shorter drivers, I am not short and it was bothersome for me). 

For upper trim levels, the interiors are much better in terms of features and fit and finish, but the ride quality and poor seating position still exists. Toyota needs to step up their game. Sure, these are reliable, but that's all the Rav has going for it. There are so many vehicles that are competing in this class and many of them ride better and are feel more premium (Nissan, Mazda, Honda and Hyundai just to name a few). I would definitely check out the competing vehicles in this class before choosing a Rav 4."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I just drove a rented RAV4 3000 miles and I am exhausted.  After reading other reviews I understand why.  It is the automated lane assist that is on with cruise.  Many times as the white line peeled off to the right for an exit it felt like the tires were grabbing a tar line.  The first couple if times it took my breath away.  At 70 MPH in the rain it was spooky.  No thanks Toyota, I'll drive the car myself."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Small cramped interior, loose steering , small seats, rides a bit stiff. Door handle awkward. Poor interior layout and I'm not usually picky. Head hits roof on way into seat I'm only 5'8"
RAV4,Edmunds,"I recently purchased a 2021 Rav4 LE AWD. There seems to be so many shortcomings in the interior design. The interior light is terribly positioned and shines directly in your eves. They do not point down, but to the side. This leaves anything you want to see in your centre console area impossible, unless you open your vanity lights. The shifter feels like it's too far to the right. Everytime I go to turn up the radio, I grab for the fan dial instead. And the position of the handle on the doors is awkward. Over half of the time leave you with a door that is not fully closed. It feels like you need to use the force of slamming your door just to have it shup properly.  The rear interior light is terribly positioned as well. It is right above the back rest part of the rear seats. This leaves the back seat feet area dark as well at the trunk. I feel like I need to have aftermarket interior lights installed!"
RAV4,Edmunds,"extremely uncomfortable interior, loud, terribly sounding engine, no headroom, hard, small seat cushions. Small trunk. Ok JBL sound system. Wish I purchased camry v6."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I have bought Rav 4's, exclusively and they have all been amazing.  My fist had 90,000 miles on and was ten years old.   Then, 2011, 2015 and now 2021.   I've had no regrets."
RAV4,Edmunds,Bought a Rav4 xle 2021. Was told it had a navigation system that work without phone. It appears to be untrue.  Get everything in wrting. Frustrated. Otherwise love it!
RAV4,Edmunds,I have had no stability problems with my 2021 Rav4.  Did the people that have consider the smoothness of the road they were on?  I have had mine up to 70 plus mph with no problems.  It rides well better than the 2011 i drove for 10 years.  I hope this one gives me the service that 2011 did.  These are fine cars and there are people that would complain even if you gave them a million dollars. Take all reviews with a grain of salt even this one if you must.
RAV4,Edmunds,"good car for the price. Like the interior styling better than how a sister....BUT....hate the fact that Toyota for 10 years can't design a simple oil filter canister like all other car brands....they have this stupid canister, drain plug, double oil ring design that sucks. Get with the 21st century Toyota"
RAV4,Edmunds,Great vehicle that has style and class and won‚Äôt break the bank.
RAV4,Edmunds,"Love my Rav4‚Ä¶.Smooth ride, lots of room, great safety features!"
RAV4,Edmunds,Excellent SUV. I liked. It is with all the powers. I like the security features. Cabin it's silent. Very comfortable. Smooth on the road. Great interiors and space.
RAV4,Edmunds,So i just bought a 2021 RAV 4 LE Wjich was not what i wanted but hey i needed a car had it for 2 weeks brand new i mind you and the car started acking crazy with my kids in it nearly causing an accident i could have hard control it they were screaming and saying get me out this car so now the engin light is on so i had to drive soslow to the dealer and it was far i got their left the car then got word they dont know what the issues is but they are still running test i saved all my money for this car cause i have sick kids and now im with outh the new one got a car note to pay on the new car i cant drive and they given me a rental Toyota is a billion dollar company if something is unsafe and now working replace it in these to.es its gard to come by money and now all what i save is in an undrivable car stuck at the shop
RAV4,Edmunds,Wonderful car with comfort and style not to mention room and great gas mileage.
RAV4,Edmunds,"I love my 2021 Toyota XLE , it handles well , I used the snow traction button tonight due to unexpected snow accumulation, it had great traction ! I like  the spaciousness and style of vehicle ! The radio sound is great . I like the fact it tells you how many miles are left to go until you need to fill car up !"
RAV4,Edmunds,"I have always owned and favored Toyota‚Äôs and Honda‚Äôs. Recently my family has had many issues with their newer model Honda‚Äôs and now Toyota seems to be lacking as well. At 3,423 miles my transmission went out in my new 2021 Rav 4. While stranded in dangerous Atlanta traffic I realized that I can no longer trust Toyota. They don‚Äôt make them like they used too! Being a mechanic for 25 plus years I would recommend staying with Japanese car manufacturers for daily drivers, but not Toyota or Honda. Do yourself a favor and buy a Mazda or Subaru. After my warranty covered the cost to replace my transmission I traded the Rav 4 in for a Subaru Crosstrek sport and I love it. It will live much longer and has great AWD capabilities. My brother has also had 10 plus years of hassle free satisfaction out of his Mazda‚Äôs. Maybe I will try Toyota again in the late future."
RAV4,Edmunds,"Hired the Hybrid and was looking forward to it.

Economy was 6 litres/100Km on mostly country driving.  Not good as my 2.0 litre 2005 BMW gets the same and does not need a battery that will need replacing at a sizeable cost.

Dynamics were ok for an entry level car.  The ABS did not do very well when stopping on dirt roads.  The traction control was worse.  If you accelerated too hard, the back swung out to the side.  Possibly it is an early (and cheaper) generation traction control unit.  Latest generation traction control and ABS measure wheel slip many times a second and hence the wheel does not noticeably slip as it slipping is stopped just as it starts.  The Toyota seemed to have a less sophisticated control unit as the wheels spun, stopped spinning, spun again, stopped spinning and spun again, which is why the rear end slid out sideways.  May work better on smooth bitumen?

Comfort was good in the front seats.  I can see people taking a test drive and being impressed.  The road noise while on a highway in the back was quite high as there is little sound insulation for the rear passengers  and the boot has places with no sound insulation at all.  To speak to the rear passengers needed us in the front to raise our voices so much that it was better to speak when in towns with slower road speed. The windows did not stop the sun burning through onto your arm. More advanced cars use different glass that looks the same but stops most of the heat getting through so passengers are more comfortable, the aircon does not need to work as hard, etc.

Safety.  The self steering was ok so long as there were well painted lines on both sides of the road such as a major multi lane highway.  On good country roads, it would it was unable to detect the left side white line unless it was new and well painted.  Roads where the left edge was less defined such as parts missing or a section was damaged where a truck ran wide in the past etc., meant the car would continue to slowly veer off the road.  So.  Ok for good highways, not for driving on the usual country roads.  Passing other cars was a bit slow.  I know that electric motors can provide enormous power short short times such as say 10 seconds (I am engineer).  Not sure why Toyota did not let the battery give the motor more power so overtaking would be safer?

Sophistication was low.  The touch panel was not intuitive to use.  If you walk up to the car and unlock it with the key fob, the windows will not wind down so you can let the car cool down before driving off.  You have to put the key fob in the centre console and push the start button.  This means there are no smarts in the electricals, it's just a wire to the switch and battery.  By comparison, in a 16 year old 3 series BMW, you can use the key fob to unlock and wind down the windows as you walk up.  No need to get in a hot car.  This is because the windows, etc., are all smart and under the control of the car's computer which does what you want when you press the fob buttons, such as just open the drivers door, or open all doors, or wind up all windows and close the sunroof as you hold the ""lock car"" button.

Overall a basic unsophisticated car.  Quite good and a cheap price (around $48K), hence maybe you cannot expect the latest (or expect a 2005 level of sophistication) such as high quality ABS and traction control, a quiet ride in the back and creature comforts."
RAV4,Edmunds,I didn't buy it
RAV4,Edmunds,Love Toyota connect
RAV4,Edmunds,"I rented a 2021 Rav4 this past weekend to visit my daughter who owns a 2017 Rav4. The legroom on the 2021's passenger side was bad. The legroom on my daughters Rav4 was 1 or 2 inches better. The 2021's engine shutdown feature when you stop sounded like the engine had bad motor mounts, if it was my car I'd be taking it to the dealer. Even my daughter thought the 2021 looked cheap. I'd steer clear of this model."
RAV4,Edmunds,Very Pleased with the purchase of this 2021 Rav4 XLE. Nice looking with great features!
RAV4,Edmunds,There‚Äôs no any towing hook in front and back of the vehicle
RAV4,Edmunds,Nice car lots of getup for a 4 cycle
RAV4,Edmunds,It‚Äôs integrated with your IPhone.
RAV4,Edmunds,"Too truckish to be a Camry Station Wagon.  Much more road noise than a Camry. Road bumps more jolting. More road vibration in the steering wheel. Highway directional stability not as good.  Upper door panels hard plastic even on the XLE. Despite these lack of Camry like characteristics and refinements, I found the Rav4 competitive with a Subaru Forester I rented.  

I believe shoppers looking for a medium sized SUV with Camry levels of quietness and ride comfort and seat comfort should look at the Toyota Venza which has great user reviews."
RAV4,Edmunds,"It‚Äôs a great car. It‚Äôs good on gas and all it‚Äôs features are pretty up to date with competitors. The entune can be annoying at times but I use CarPlay so it doesn‚Äôt bother me. The engine is very loud, a common Toyota thing, so it feels pretty rugged when driving which can be good and bad. There is quite a bit of road noise but most cars have that. All around great reliable and safe car, as Toyota‚Äôs always are."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I love my rav4xle it‚Äôs fast, spacious and good on gas mileage."
RAV4,Edmunds,"RAV4 TRD Off Road.  Best car I've ever owned.  Great mileage, super handling and comfortable on the open road.  In town turning and parking a dream.  Just a great all around vehicle. Capable of more then I use it for.  Nice to know its there if I need it.  Don't need a ""rock crawler""."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I trade my 2021 rav4, at first 4 months you feel it comfortable, but you get through more it get rough, my wife got dizzy in front passenger, and my kids complain at the back, (im drove by the limit) the braking system was getting hard even i press gently, the price was not match to what you paying for, ive been in toyota for my 2 car, now im enjoying another japanese brand, hohohoo"
RAV4,Edmunds,"Without car play.The trunk does not open from the car.Poor interior of the car, there is no way to control the phone from the steering wheel"
RAV4,Edmunds,"It‚Äôs my second RAV4, loved my 2006, it was almost 300,000 miles, it was faithful."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I would highly recommend this car, if you get it blacked out it is very sexy and drives very smoothly. The sound system is good and the back up camera is very useful. If you‚Äôre on the fence- get one!"
RAV4,Edmunds,I recommend this adorable car. I am also satisfied with a good customer service of the dealer and the seller.
RAV4,Edmunds,Great HWY and City gas mileage...seeing 32 city and 36 HWY!  Plenty of room!!!  Bigger than previous models. Plenty of power.  Get the faux leather seats on the XLE Premium - def worth it!    Great on road trips and tailgating.
RAV4,Edmunds,So far there is nothing I dislike about it.  I can't imagine that anything is missing from it
RAV4,Edmunds,I‚Äôve had 3 Rav 4 2021 the first 2 had problems with transmission if I‚Äôm stopped put on the gas quickly I go nowhere it goes nowhere now I have my third car snd today at a stop sign when I left the stop sign to go into another road it cut out on me and went nowhere very upset and it‚Äôs very dangerous
RAV4,Edmunds,Beautiful drive and comfortable
RAV4,Edmunds,"- Fuel consumption issue didn‚Äôt meet advertised fuel consumption rating; poor gas tank design
- Poor handling; read the moose test
- Poor sound insulation; very noisy ride that even loud music can‚Äôt fixed
- Expensive for what you get; go read consumer reports to see why it‚Äôs ranked lower than a cheaper Tuscan
- subjective, but it‚Äôs ugly as sin with interiors that look like something from the 90s
- don‚Äôt buy this; my experience been nothing but regret only bought because so many praise Toyota but I think they‚Äôre just coasting off their antique reputation"
RAV4,Edmunds,As a senior citizen the electronic are too confusing
RAV4,Edmunds,I haven't used it alot yet but satisfied with it.the only cons is that It does not have remote start function
RAV4,Edmunds,I had a 2018 Rav4 and other earlier years that I loved. Perfect size and handled nice. Not liking the changes in the 2021. Why do they keep making it bigger ?! I liked the Rav for its smaller size but still being a SUV. Do not like the longer length at all. Also does not handle as well as the 2018. Think ill be looking for something new ( not Toyota) for my next SUV.
RAV4,Edmunds,The Rav4 is an excellent SUV. Whats not to like? Great engine a non-turbo long lasting reliable AWD vehicle.  Nice interior more space than the Venza.
RAV4,Edmunds,Love the car but engine is slow on acceleration. Would be nice if they offered nor V6 options.
RAV4,Edmunds,"The Rav4 is good looking car with ample room and drivability. We had the Limited Trim, which was fully loaded including the Advanced Technology package. Ours was not a hybrid and gas mileage for in-town use was a bit disappointing at 23.5 MPG. When accelerating, the engine was a bit noisy and the wind noise was pretty loud. Understand that we also have a 2021 Venza which is quieter, more luxurious, and gets 39 MPG without blinking an eye. In direct comparison, the RAV4 falls short. Both vehicles are the highest trim and are only about $2500 apart in MSRP."
RAV4,Edmunds,"We rented one of these for two weeks when a vehicle was in the shop. We got the AWD because we live in Alaska and this is an AWD SUV, right? We‚Äôve owned Toyotas for years and figured no issues.
Wrong.
We got about 10‚Äù of snow one night and this vehicle could not get out of the driveway. It got stuck in the snow in the driveway.
Several issues:
1. AWD is decent for driving down the road in some inclement weather. it is bad when stuck. 4WD would sent power to all 4 wheels. AWD varies the power by what the computer wants to do, not where I want the power to go. This is why it‚Äôs good to avoid AWD if you are going to need power to all 4 wheels irrespective of what the computer says.
2. The ground clearance on this is horrible for a vehicle that claims to be an SUV. I can understand if this were a commuter vehicle like a Camry or Maxima or Impala. But this just does not work.
3. The vehicle has NO tow bolts. So we are trying to find a place to attach the tow rope and there is no place to attach it. We wound up using part of the upper engine frame because we had nowhere else to attach the tow rope. And even then, the vehicle could not overcome the amount of snow.,

Takeaway: if you live in Arizona or Texas or Florida where you never get snow, this would likely work. Bit of rain, even torrential rain, and AWD will do you fine for the roads. But if you live in Alaska or Montana or Idaho or Maine where you can get snow, and I mean real snow, not just a dusting here and there, do yourself a favor. Just get a real 4WD SUV with some ground clearance, tow hooks in the front and back, and some decent tires. The time will come when you will thank me."
RAV4,Edmunds,"In all the car has good look and technology, I have just drove it 1000 miles and here are some of the things I would love the Toyota has to improve. Driver and passenger door handles from inside are located in a place where it is hard to close especially for my wife, I have to pull it hard to get it close. Acceleration is good but not very good when you want to pass another vehicle while you are driving 55 - 65 mph even in sports mood.  
Fuel economy is not what I have expected it displays my average mpg 30-31 on console  but the actual mpg is lower around 22-26 combined. I drive it almost 40 miles a day that is 8 miles city and the rest is highway. All in all it seems a good car."
RAV4,Edmunds,Like all Toyotas this vehicle is top-notch especially for the price
RAV4,Edmunds,Great fuel efficiency and amazing driving assistance technologies
RAV4,Edmunds,Bought HNov. 21 to drive back and forth from AZ to see kids in Ca and save money on gas. Rides smooth at high speeds. Seats little hard so i put on a set of WET OKOLE neoprene seat covers which helped. No shaking or vibration issues. No rattling. Runs great.
RAV4,Edmunds,I have a 2021 Rav 4 Hybrid with 6000 kilometers.  The battery has died two times already when the weather is below minus 10C. This is going to become a big problem with me. I recommend you consider this before you buy one. I hope they fix this problem soon
RAV4,Edmunds,"The tailgate rattles like no SUV I‚Äôve ever owned.  The car makes a sound when moving like a brake is locked up and dragging.  Took in twice now in the first year to find out why and the dealer says he can‚Äôt find the source of the noise, suggests I drive it until it breaks since there are 2 years left on the warranty.  Last Toyota for me."
RAV4,Edmunds,"I purchased my 2021 Toyota Rav4 new in August. The panels between the front and rear windows on both sides of my car are discolored and look like the plastic is melting. Magee Toyota in Hanover, MA replaced one side in January. Within a month both side panels discolored again right where the brackets are. I contacted Toyota and requested a meeting with a Toyota Service Department supervisor. They had a representative contact me, and I was told that the problem is Solar related and they will not help with the problem. I have a bumper to bumper warranty and the windows are between the bumpers, but they will do nothing."
RAV4,Edmunds,"First, the fuel economy is great. Although it only has 205 HP, with the turbo it does just fine on acceleration. Break system is very good as well has stable during hard breaking.. Road noise ? Very quite. The motors does get heard when mashing the gas, but what do you expect. Got the LE AWD with cloth seat, didn't want leather. The reason I went with the Toyota is the 100,000 mile warranty is transferable, when non of the other would transfer. When you pay $30K for a vehicle, put 7K miles on it, then get a offer from the dealer of $5K more than I paid for it, seems I did good on this one."
