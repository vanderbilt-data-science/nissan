Rogue,Cars,I’ve had my 2021 Rogue SL with the premium package for a month now. What a change from previous Nissans!  I love all the technology and convenient features. The 9 inch touch screen is responsive and very easy to see in bright sun. Love the panoramic sunroof and the quality of the interior. The seats are so comfortable. Ride quality is improved. People who complain about a 2.5 with a CVT should not be shopping for 4 cylinder SUV. Who cares how fast it gets to 60 mph?  This SUV in sport mode does just fine when needed. I have to say this has much more responsive acceleration off the line than my Murano had but I get much better fuel economy. I usually drive mine in auto or eco modes to take advantage of the better mpg. I give Nissan huge kudos and was happy to get this 2.5 4 cylinder since 2022s are all 1.5 turbo 3 cylinders.  Yes better gas mileage but the 2.5 is proven and solid.,0.0,0.9775738716125488,0.0,0.9944573640823364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9213042259216309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9876482486724854,0.0,0.0,0.0
Rogue,Cars,"I have to preface this by saying I purchased another new car recently and it ended up being a Lemon which the manufacturer repurchased (or is repurchasing because the process drags on forever). That said, I’m a little hyper sensitive to any issues with cars right now. I test drove the Rogue just to “check it out” with no intention on purchasing so quickly after my Lemon experience but I fell in love with it. It’s roomy, has a ton of great features, crystal clear back up/surround camera, awesome moonroof, great MPG’s, etc etc.  Even though the features and look of the car is great, I noticed little glitches from day one. The cameras would switch on randomly when slowing the car during travel, the automatic breaking warning light would come on and then turn off, the radio was working and then sounded like I was in a tunnel and then resumed playing normally, AC blew hot air when on cool until I turned it down to “Lo”, the touch screen acts crazy here and there, etc etc. For the most part I wrote these things off as “user error” or accepting that maybe the car just acted like this. BUT…today after owning the car for about two weeks/600 miles the emergency breaking malfunction light came on and remained on (I’m talking about the big, bright notice that pops up in your dash cluster). Like the other “glitches” the malfunction light disappeared when I parked, turned off the car and then turned it on again. I realized that the glitches might be a little more than what I originally thought though. Having the malfunction light in addition to the warning symbols prompted me to take the car in to service. I’m currently waiting to find out what the issue is and how long it will take to fix. I also did some more review reading and I have to say that I’m really nervous that the car will have continuing issues. The reviews on this site are fairly positive but if you look around a bit more you find some scary stuff about this car. I really thought there was no possible way that I would have this type of experience with TWO brand new cars within a six month period but here we are. I hope this is just some weird full moon voodoo that gets repaired and never causes me an issue again but I’m really not that confident in that right now. All I’m saying is…be careful!",0.0,0.6715329885482788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9340689182281494,0.0,0.36673665046691895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7367855310440063,0.0,0.0,0.09922516345977783

Rogue,Cars,"I have owned/leased Nissans since 1997. I had a 1997,  2001, 2004 and 2013 Pathfinder. I had a 2007 Xterra, 2011 Rogue, 2016 Murano and the 2019 Rogue SL. I have to say that the 2021 Rogue SL, with the premium package is my best leased Nissan yet. Coming from the 2011 & 2019 Rogue, the 2021 is a BIG improvement. The exterior is beautiful and the interior is so luxurious without the luxurious price tag. I did not think I would like the gear shifter, but I love it, especially now that I have more storage space underneath it and the cup holders are up higher. I have loved the zero gravity seats since my 2013 Pathfinder. OMG, they are so comfortable and the back seats are a little bit higher and I love that too. The back doors opening at a 90 degree angle is like the best thing EVER. The ability  to unlock all the doors from all 4 doors is a great feature as well.  I just leased mine on memorial day, and I am 110% in love. They have made the cabin quieter and even though it is just 11hp more, you can definitely feel the difference. It lagged a bit in the 2019, but not this 2021. Huge difference in acceleration alone! Still log my propilot assist, lane change monitoring and so much more. The wireless connection to my iphone is great too.

Rogue,Cars,"A beautiful car, but with some annoying problems:
- Shaking / vibrating when driving or accelerating slowly. 
- The hand break stays on regularly when I start driving - for a few seconds, making the engine roar. Won’t get off even if I try to turn it off (and it is supposed to go off automatically).
- Stop hold feature: I love the idea, as I have knee problems and it releases tension in my right knee, but for some reason, when I stay on it for a while (e.g. at the drive thru), it doesn’t come off when I try to drive again. When this happens, I need to stop the car, turn it off, and  turn it back on... Can be dangerous in some situations. Also: the Cruise control with Pro Pilot is a bit scary, as when the car before me changes lane, it starts accelerating way too fast to reach the set speed now that the obstacle is gone. I usually turn it off to control my acceleration on my own.

After pick up again they told me a Nissan engineer worked on the car and it was SAFE to drive!!  It WASN'T!!! It died an hour later in a middle of an intersection where I almost got tbone by a semitruck!!!! Good Samaritans tried to moved the car from the road.  Not even the neutral was working!  It took several strong men to move it out of the intersection and calmed down until my husband arrived!  It was a horrible nightmare!  The dealership didn't take responsibility or ownership of the problem. So now Nissan Corp needs to do it right! We lost of trust!!

Totally unnecessary. The upholstery design is decent with 2 tone style but the ugly cheap and horrid line pattern on the seats and doors is a down right afterthought.

Rogue,Cars,Review is for 2021 Rogue SL AWD with the Premium package. Looks - get the 2 tone it's so good looking and the body style redesign is fantastic. Bose audio is outstanding (only available with Premium or Platinum). Lots of tech... Be prepared that this vehicle is DIFFERENT. Driving is with a knob and more buttons and switches. This is my 3rd Rogue and I love them but you need to test drive it first to make sure you are okay with the new way to drive it! Cargo area is smaller than my 2018 but I'm okay with that... Lots of room if you fold down the back seats which is easier now. Divider between driver and passenger takes getting used to... Not sure if that's an improvement because the open space under the center divider could be easy to get your hand stuck in. The button placements are much better now but the start button doesn't illuminate so make sure you set your interior lights properly so you can see the button. Overall I'm really loving it but it might not be roomy enough for every driver.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.996493935585022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Equinox,Cars,"For the brief time I have owned the 2021 Equinox(3 weeks) it has been good.  Gas mileage in 2wd is good and the battery is somewhat easily accessible.  Oil changes should be relatively simple as filter is easily accessed.  

  The ""advanced safety features"" are annoying more often than not and they will go off simply because a car in the opposite lane passes you.  As a result I have deactivated them all.

  Most can be permanently deactivated but the ""auto start/stop"" requires more effort to permanently deactivate.  Have yet found a way to remove the front camera to disable the most annoying safety features.   

The ""lane keep assist"" can be turned off but must be deactivated every time you start the vehicle, another reason I wish to remove the front camera entirely as I do not desire the subtle steering wheel impulses while driving on snow and ice.

Escape,Cars,"So far Im really surprised with the 2021 Escape in all my needs. At the dealer I test drove 4 2020 escapes and they all all had a jerky transmission shifting as so many people claim in the 2020 Escape. I test drove 2 - 2021 escapes and both shifted perfect So I ended up with the SEL model and so far hasn't had that problem, shifts very smooth and the 1.5L 3 banger really gets up and goes. All around driving MPG is getting better, Im at 24.9 MPG and climbing with 236 miles. Had a 2019 Jeep Cherokee before this and its much smoother ride, better mileage and quieter at highway speeds. I will say this comparing both, the Escape is much easier to get in and out of for a older person 88 years old, very short mother with a bad hip and shoulder. She use to have a rough time of it and she didnt want no help. The escape since is is about 2 inches lower in seat height and narrower in the door jam makes all the difference to her. Windows are lower too so she can see out better as well. I looked as MANY SUV's and my goal was to find a easy get in and out of, this was my only choice. There were a couple others made in South KOREA that would have worked for her but they were just to small for my needs.

Bronco Sport,Cars,"I was blinding by the popularity of this truck, I am not going to lie.
I LOVE how the Bronco turns heads & that there are not too many on the road.  My Bronco came with drama like most things that are popular do. One dealership told me the three Broncos that they had were not for sale & that I was not able to even test drive them, I thought ""WHAT??"" 

Then it became a vendetta to own a Bronco. When I finally found a dealership willing to let me test drive one, I don't know if I was more about getting a Bronco by any means  at this point or if I really liked it.

I purchased the base stock example model with 2435 miles on it, so I figured it had been broke in some.  What was included cloth seats *not heated, weather floor mats, *no XM radio (which drives me crazy on my long drives) *no tinted windows (the dealership tint my windows). NO PUSH START, Key FOB. :-(.

Now I have 5,895 miles on it. This car at first glance looked just like my 2006 Honda Pilot, but smaller. I have so far had to take it in for a recall: *""for the rear suspension modules that may not be fully secured to the subframe, which may increase the risk of an accident. The defect: rear suspension modules with loose or missing bolts.""""

So in the service bay the Bronco goes, the dealership took over three hours to look at it. While waiting for service I overhear the worker say, ""I don't even know what to look for"". After three hours I was told ""ok it looks good"".  I had doubts.

Now I hear this rubbing noise in the back like a howling  could it be the rear breaks? (Thought not this early no way.)  Another thing happen that alarmed me, my lights inside/outside all came on & stayed on & then I was not able to turn it off with the key fob, I had to put the key in the ignition to get the car to turn off the lights. 

I don't know if it would run down the battery or not, but for a new car I was alarmed. I plan on calling the dealer for another service date. I am  planning on trading this in for the ""REAL BRONCO"" not totally in love with my Sport AKA the Little Sister Bronco.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014178872108459473,0.0,0.33911728858947754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5134588479995728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Bronco Sport,Cars,"I've been waiting for the Bronco to come out for years and I have to say I was a little disappointed when I checked it out. I did not test drive or purchase this car so my review is NOT based on the performance. I looked at the Bad Lands and the Big Bend.

First thought of the Ford Bronco Sport is that its sporty looking, what was Ford waiting for? I popped the hood and it seemed wonky coming up like the hinges would give you a problem if you off roaded your SUV. Next would be the interior, I looked at the Big Bend and the Bad Lands and I was so sad to see how cheap it felt inside. It had lots of head room and leg room but the dash, console, and plastic door panels felt like it would not last long. I wish the center console were bigger for more shoulder room. Did I mention the cup holders? There weren't many and none that would fit a large cup or bottle.

II liked the engine bay, it would be easy to work on this yourself if that was ever needed. The seats had a neat feature with zippers and molle loops in the rear. The overall look is great! 

I will consider purchasing one next year if some interior features are updated.",0.989990234375,0.8109167814254761,0.9851994514465332,0.9883815050125122,0.07103204727172852,0.8375202417373657,0.8565763235092163,0.19153904914855957,0.937401533126831,0.7738401889801025,0.9845999479293823,0.7396169900894165,0.7512930631637573,0.8994278907775879,0.5257730484008789,0.7853466272354126,0.566338062286377

As someone who is 6'3, I do feel comfortable with head clearance and room within the front.  No other vehicle within this category accommodates.

Bronco Sport,Cars,"Wow! I went in to my local dealer kinda sorta interested in one last week. After the test drive I was instantly sold on it and had it delivered to me on Saturday AM!

So far I’m loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It’s a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I’m not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven’t seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I’m not crazy about, it is the “Auto-Stop” function that shuts down the car at lights. I’m really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven’t used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I’ve mostly stayed in “standard” mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I’m not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles. 

Super stoked that I was able to get it soooooooo easily and quickly when I’m seeing online that a lot of people are having trouble! I looked at one on Tuesday and they had me the model I wanted delivered to my work on my break Saturday! Paperwork took 15 minutes...they drive my trade in away and that was that!

Tucson,Cars,"It is a very nice car for the value!!  Lots of bells and whistles technology wise.   I returned my Grand Cherokee lease and decided to give it a try for the last month.  I purchased the Ultimate trim with AWD.  It’s a very comfortable car and drives fairly smooth considering the driving conditions I’ve dealt with the last few weeks(heavy snow/rain).  In the snow, it handled pretty well, I did hear some snow scrape underneath but that was because of the lower clearance.  The handling is pretty good and responds well.   The gas mileage is okay for a 4 cylinder, I avg about 22.5.  The sound system is very nice but I feel that the way the entire radio system/screen works will take some getting used to from my previous car.  When I helped someone move, the cargo capacity with the rear seats folded down was equal to my grand Cherokee as I was able to fit 9 boxes.  The little downfalls with the car aren’t a deal breaker to me but might be important to others.  There are no memory seats.  The 4 cylinder acceleration isn’t impressive but does as it is needed.  And possibly the one thing I do find someone annoying is the key itself.  The buttons are very very sensitive!  I’ve found myself getting into my car on several occasions with the key in my pocket and I somehow am opening up the tailgate.  I’ve also once activated panic alarm unknowingly.  This alone in my opinion can be something that maybe Hyundai can modify in the future.  But all in all, for the cost it’s a very good car and I would recommend it.

CX-5,Cars,"This car is a dream come true for me. It has plenty of fun entertainment features to make me happy without overwhelming me with too much on my dash at once. I test drove a Rav4 and while it was a nice car as well, the dash reminded me of a space ship b/c there was so much going on at once and I struggled to even locate my current speed amongst everything else. With my Mazda I can opt to keep it simple or put more information up on my dash as I want and the speedometer is never part of that particular part of the dash area so no worries about not knowing how fast I'm going. it has wonderful cruise control features that make traveling long distances on the interstate a dream come true. It's stylish and comfortable with plenty of room. The front seats recline almost to a full lay down position which is an awesome feature for me since I enjoy napping in my car on my lunch break sometimes and it makes it so much more comfortable that way. The trunk space is plenty roomy for a small family with no kids, or one kid, and i love the one touch open and close feature. the backup camera is like watching a hi-def movie it's so clear and the safety features with the lane assist and even coupled with the back up camera sensors to warn you if someone is coming along your sides that you can't see quite yet, can't be beat. the back seats can fold down in three seperate ways so that you have versatile options for transporting larger items that won't fit just in the back hatch. I've had this car for about a month now and I don't have anything bad to say about it honestly. I love everything about it and I used to loathe driving and now I love it thanks to Mazda and my CX-5.",0.9438146352767944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9913479089736938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911975383758545,0.0,0.0

CX-5,Cars,"I reviewed this car on another popular website. I wanted to give more details here. Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range.

CX-5,Cars,"Just leased my second Mazda, a CX-5 Grand Touring (base trim - no Prem Pkg) and I'm pretty pleased so far. Having come from a 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5's ride is a bit on the firm side, but is fine. The non-turbo engine is surprisingly peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The smartphone remote feature, 10.25"" info screen and upgraded infotainment system are welcome additions, albeit one too many steps needed in the infotainment to execute relatively simple tasks. The one feature I'm disappointed with is the Bose system. It has decent sound, but comes across more muddy and muffled than I'd like, even with the available sound enhancement settings and features. To me, It just doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose system that I had in the CX- 9, or those found in the Premium 3 / CX-30's I test drove (if you’re a bit of an audiophile, you might consider one of these aforementioned models). The 5 is a great CUV, and could be even better if it had the same Bose setup found in the 3 / CX-30. That would make it a home run. Maybe Mazda will up the sound game for the 5's next generation model. I'm hoping so.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5385658740997314,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,Cars,"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily found with the hand without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn’t as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff – which we don’t.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content – if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.

Forester,Cars,"Had never seriously considered a Subaru. After some research, had decided on purchasing a used VW Alltrack. Checked dealer Web site again the morning i planned to purchase the VW and on a whim, browsed Subaru. 1st pic that came up was interior of a 2021 white Forester Sport. Perhaps because I was coming from a VW Passat known for its very conservative styling, I was instantly smitten w the Forester interior. After doing some more research I decided on the Forester. I bought it used w about 2.4K mikes on it. It served as a demo car. I feel the $27k price was quite fair. 

Visibility is amazing. I’m 6’3” and there is still plenty of headroom left. The tall side glass and clever side mirror placement and extra triangle glass makes seeing out a breeze. Even rearward visibility is great. The extra large sunroof makes for an even airier environment. I will say the front seat bottom is just long enough. Any shorter and for me it would be an uncomfortable ride. If your inseam is longer than 36” the seats might be uncomfortable for you. While the back seat bottoms are just long enough for most, and the area is very roomy my legs couldn’t endure a king ride back there. But again I’m quite tall so it shouldn’t be a problem For most. Those who have rode in the back find it very comfortable and enjoy that the seating height is higher than in front giving them a great view ahead. Cargo room is what i really love.  W the seats down, I can fit my 2x bike in there without removing the wheels. That’s a big deal for me.  

I find the power more than sufficient for the vehicle type and my mainly commuting purposes. I find the acceleration very responsive when I apply smooth steady pressure to the gas pedal. Punching the pedal, for me, resulted in a brash take off that seemed slower overall than when I apply a steady foot. I just took my first road trip, 600 miles, and now it seems the vehicle is broken in and the responsiveness is even better. Currently have about 4.2k mikes on it. 

This Sport came w the upgrade package that incl Harmon sound, auto back up monitor and braking and power lift gate. The suite of safety features is complete - lane departure, auto braking to emergency stop, adaptive cruise. The cruise works very well and accelerates very well when the car slows down for slower traffic and then finds sufficient open space to increase speed. Over the month I’ve had it I’ve learned how to manage the safety features and drive in such a way that it’s not annoying at all. Doing simple things like always signaling when changing lanes prevents the steering wheel from bucking back against your steering inputs. The torque vectoring allows for snappy handling when switching lanes and the turning radius is very tight and makes for great parking lot maneuvering.

I love driving this CUV. I recent sat in a family members Rogue and then another’s CRV. I left both thinking I’m so glad I got the Subaru. When I see VW Alltracks drive by, I thank my lucky stars I did not get it. I highly recommend this vehicle.",0.0,0.6891562938690186,0.9842852354049683,0.9240754842758179,0.8193769454956055,0.9446874856948853,0.811293363571167,0.7354015111923218,0.992632269859314,0.9245872497558594,0.9844735860824585,0.0,0.3321957588195801,0.0,0.3831993341445923,0.0,0.8909780979156494

Rogue,KBB,"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn’t even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven’t seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, “SUVs are just not that exciting.” I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It’s comfortable, but it’s also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn’t have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I’ve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I’m excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn’t feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one.

Rogue,KBB,"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Rogue,KBB,"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver’s side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver’s side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the “infotainment system” has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the “camera” button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an “off” type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70’s where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe.",0.9889681339263916,0.0,0.8943691253662109,0.0,0.0,0.9858684539794922,0.5922706127166748,0.48927533626556396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018607497215270996

Rogue,KBB,"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn’t even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven’t seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, “SUVs are just not that exciting.” I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It’s comfortable, but it’s also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn’t have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I’ve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I’m excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn’t feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one.

Rogue,KBB,"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver’s side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the “infotainment system” has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the “camera” button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an “off” type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70’s where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe.",0.9889681339263916,0.0,0.8943691253662109,0.0,0.0,0.9858684539794922,0.5922706127166748,0.48927533626556396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018607497215270996

Rogue,KBB,"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn’t even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven’t seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, “SUVs are just not that exciting.” I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It’s comfortable, but it’s also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn’t have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I’ve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I’m excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn’t feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one.

Rogue,KBB,"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Rogue,KBB,"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver’s side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver’s side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

The touch screen info system is often unresponsive which makes a change difficult when driving. There is a LOT of wind/ road noise T 60mph. At 1,000 rpm the steering wheel vibrates.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours?

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours?

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Escape,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172497034072876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8847991228103638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Bronco Sport,KBB,"Ordered a lovely cyber orange color Bronco sport , production delays and i’m still waiting. 
I see stock car getting to dealers but not my customer order. It’s a fairly simple Badlands version with a tow package .
I found almost the same suv  just delivered to a dealer but without the tow package AND a $5000 over sticker cost! (Where’s mine?).
If I’m going to spend $40k on a vehicle I’m not buying off the lot and getting more or less that I want , I expect to have this car for 15 years as my retirement vehicle and don’t want to live with a compromise!
Fortunately I can wait. But it’s disappointing to see stock builds getting priority over a customer order. I guess Ford wants to protect their dealers who are struggling with lack of product to sell.

I moved up from a 2009 Escape which I loved, but the Bronco is even better and more capable for rougher road conditions.  Perfect size for my needs.  Small enough for easy maneuvering and parking, but big enough to see over other traffic.  Enough room for me and a buddy and our outdoor gear.  Roof rack handles 2 kayaks easily.  Badlands edition with off road tires has plenty of power and still gets decent gas mileage (about 25 mpg combined).  Love the unique retro style that sets it apart from the sea of SUV’s.  Minor downsides: don’t care for the auto start/stop feature, and I’m still not in the habit of disabling it every time I start up.  Rear window wiper motor creates a blind spot.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is my first Ford and I’m impressed!  This vehicle handles great in snow & ice on the hills and the straightaway’s. I haven’t had one issue with this truck. And that’s not all… this truck is sooo cool looking! I get looks everywhere I go!! It gets pretty good gas mileage and the engine shut off at stop lights doesn’t bother me. I had a Lexus hybrid before I bought my baby Bronco (BIG step up for me) so I was sort of used to it. The Bronco Sport’s turn radius is super tight and I was amazed at how comfortable a ride it has.
I was lucky and found my Outer Banks on a lot. I got her for sticker price and she was loaded with all the bells and whistles- the only thing this one didn’t have that I sort of wanted was a moon roof. With the chip shortage that wasn’t possible at the time. 
I love Co-pilot 360 assist, remote start, the rubber floor mats, heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, rain sensing wipers, and the Bang & Olufsen stereo, etc. I can live without the moon roof. 
My interior is great quality and really cool looking!  I think the quality of the interior is excellent if you get the Outer Banks, Badlands or First Edition. If you get the base or Big Bend  models the interior is cheap.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"Just purchased our Bronco Sport (Base) three weeks ago.  I've been enamored with the Bronco for quite some time and finally made the decision to purchase 'Sarge' and enjoy the unique Bronco Sport ownership experience.  I love this machine.  I purchased the Base model because it was the only one on the dealer's lot and the only one available to purchase within 200 miles.  The only other option was to order one and wait a year for delivery.  I'm not getting any younger, so when the dealer offered to drive the vehicle to me and perform the contract on the dining room table, I agreed and I'm glad I did.  As a caraholic, I've had many vehicles in my life and this Bronco is unique to any other I've owned; most of which were hot rods (Corvettes, Mustangs and a Shelby GT) or pickup trucks.  Because the Base model has no hi-tech options, I thought I would miss them, but I found that the 'Base Model' driving experience is much more enjoyable than I ever would have imagined.  I really wanted the 4-cylinder option, but settled for the 180 HP three banger since I had no other choice.  I'm not disappointed; however, because 'Sarge' (you can tell I'm a 30-year military guy) gets down the road and off road just fine.  In 'Eco' GOAT mode, I'm averaging 26 MGP which is pretty doggone good for a 4-wheel drive off-road oriented machine.  My wife's 2020 Escape (same chassis) provides a totally different driving experience in regards to comfort etc. Thus far, I'm quite pleased with the vehicle and my decision to purchase it.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"Ordered a lovely cyber orange color Bronco sport , production delays and i’m still waiting. 
I see stock car getting to dealers but not my customer order. It’s a fairly simple Badlands version with a tow package .
I found almost the same suv  just delivered to a dealer but without the tow package AND a $5000 over sticker cost! (Where’s mine?).
If I’m going to spend $40k on a vehicle I’m not buying off the lot and getting more or less that I want , I expect to have this car for 15 years as my retirement vehicle and don’t want to live with a compromise!
Fortunately I can wait. But it’s disappointing to see stock builds getting priority over a customer order. I guess Ford wants to protect their dealers who are struggling with lack of product to sell.

I moved up from a 2009 Escape which I loved, but the Bronco is even better and more capable for rougher road conditions.  Perfect size for my needs.  Small enough for easy maneuvering and parking, but big enough to see over other traffic.  Enough room for me and a buddy and our outdoor gear.  Roof rack handles 2 kayaks easily.  Badlands edition with off road tires has plenty of power and still gets decent gas mileage (about 25 mpg combined).  Love the unique retro style that sets it apart from the sea of SUV’s.  Minor downsides: don’t care for the auto start/stop feature, and I’m still not in the habit of disabling it every time I start up.  Rear window wiper motor creates a blind spot.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"This is my first Ford and I’m impressed!  This vehicle handles great in snow & ice on the hills and the straightaway’s. I haven’t had one issue with this truck. And that’s not all… this truck is sooo cool looking! I get looks everywhere I go!! It gets pretty good gas mileage and the engine shut off at stop lights doesn’t bother me. I had a Lexus hybrid before I bought my baby Bronco (BIG step up for me) so I was sort of used to it. The Bronco Sport’s turn radius is super tight and I was amazed at how comfortable a ride it has.
I was lucky and found my Outer Banks on a lot. I got her for sticker price and she was loaded with all the bells and whistles- the only thing this one didn’t have that I sort of wanted was a moon roof. With the chip shortage that wasn’t possible at the time. 
I love Co-pilot 360 assist, remote start, the rubber floor mats, heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, rain sensing wipers, and the Bang & Olufsen stereo, etc. I can live without the moon roof. 
My interior is great quality and really cool looking!  I think the quality of the interior is excellent if you get the Outer Banks, Badlands or First Edition. If you get the base or Big Bend  models the interior is cheap.

Bronco Sport,KBB,"Just purchased our Bronco Sport (Base) three weeks ago.  I've been enamored with the Bronco for quite some time and finally made the decision to purchase 'Sarge' and enjoy the unique Bronco Sport ownership experience.  I love this machine.  I purchased the Base model because it was the only one on the dealer's lot and the only one available to purchase within 200 miles.  The only other option was to order one and wait a year for delivery.  I'm not getting any younger, so when the dealer offered to drive the vehicle to me and perform the contract on the dining room table, I agreed and I'm glad I did.  As a caraholic, I've had many vehicles in my life and this Bronco is unique to any other I've owned; most of which were hot rods (Corvettes, Mustangs and a Shelby GT) or pickup trucks.  Because the Base model has no hi-tech options, I thought I would miss them, but I found that the 'Base Model' driving experience is much more enjoyable than I ever would have imagined.  I really wanted the 4-cylinder option, but settled for the 180 HP three banger since I had no other choice.  I'm not disappointed; however, because 'Sarge' (you can tell I'm a 30-year military guy) gets down the road and off road just fine.  In 'Eco' GOAT mode, I'm averaging 26 MGP which is pretty doggone good for a 4-wheel drive off-road oriented machine.  My wife's 2020 Escape (same chassis) provides a totally different driving experience in regards to comfort etc. Thus far, I'm quite pleased with the vehicle and my decision to purchase it.

CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high.

However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features

The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features

CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time.",0.9765942096710205,0.5811209678649902,0.0,0.33648109436035156,0.16643953323364258,0.0,0.4247678518295288,0.028832197189331055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.461545467376709,0.0,0.24395418167114258,0.0,0.23697102069854736

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features

CR-V,KBB,"During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time.",0.9765942096710205,0.5811209678649902,0.0,0.33648109436035156,0.16643953323364258,0.0,0.4247678518295288,0.028832197189331055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.461545467376709,0.0,0.24395418167114258,0.0,0.23697102069854736

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features

The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time.",0.9765942096710205,0.5811209678649902,0.0,0.33648109436035156,0.16643953323364258,0.0,0.4247678518295288,0.028832197189331055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.461545467376709,0.0,0.24395418167114258,0.0,0.23697102069854736

CR-V,KBB,"I love my 2019 Honda C-RV Touring. Typical of Honda, ALL its features are thoughtful and easy to use. For example: Honda examined how owners use the lift gate. Its controls are perfect. Opening, closing when out shopping--perfect! Similarly with the so-called moon roof. Even the center consul padding under one's right elbow seems just right. 

I use machinery like chain saws and lawn mowers. All fit easily into the cargo area. I like to think of my C-RV as a great pick up truck. Do NOT get Honda's cargo area covering. I did, hated it, Honda took it back reluctantly, and I went for Weather Tech's MUCH BETTER flooring. Honda, if you're reading: take note!

Power. I bought the  1.5L turbo 4-cylinder engine and am glad I did. It shows its worth went entering a high speed traffic stream, say, on an Interstate. I punch it and the car is up to traffic stream speed in two seconds flat. Feels great! I highly recommend this engine.

I drove VW's Touareg. I could not enter traffic streams in the effortless way I did with the C-RV turbo. I could not ""punch"" the VW. 

Comfort. Excellent. The one con is that the cabin sound level from the slip stream seems a tad high. 

If you live in northern climes--New England, etc. the heated seats are a  great feature. 

So is the remote start. I loved starting the car from inside my house of frigid days. The remote start just starts the engine, not climate control, etc. But by the time you get in, the engine is able to supply warm air instantly. I highly recommend remote start.

Fuel Economy: This is why my 2019 C-RV gets 4 out of 5 performance stars. I've never actually tested the car, but my sense is that it doesn't quite live up to its billing on this point. But nevertheless, fuel economy is good. I have no complaints.

Handling. Excellent. Drives like a dream. I love driving winding roads. The C-RV handles them beautifully.

Styling. She looks like a locomotive from the front. Not quite a stylish as I'd like, but this is truly a matter of taste, isn't it?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584518313407898,0.0,0.8973685503005981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8322912454605103,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809
Tucson,KBB,"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the “dual clutch transmission” (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don’t mind the plastic interior. It’s easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won’t feel like I’m treating it badly. I can’t see myself in any other current CUV.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money.",0.0,0.45854413509368896,0.5757137537002563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13072848320007324,0.5154584646224976,0.5421935319900513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43477940559387207

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.

comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

Tucson,KBB,"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined.

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tucson,KBB,THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.,0.9925878047943115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013343214988708496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Tucson,KBB,"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that",0.31873762607574463,0.2919055223464966,0.22595155239105225,0.397737979888916,0.3327583074569702,0.07787013053894043,0.23227882385253906,0.05887246131896973,0.31214094161987305,0.6581078767776489,0.49528050422668457,0.3298712968826294,0.019218802452087402,0.19061529636383057,0.3169296979904175,0.26984238624572754,0.007928252220153809

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined.

It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed.

~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9816223382949829,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated.

My one gripe about this car is it is notoriously easy to steal. 
I didn't realize it until mine was stolen last week and I googled 'Kia Sportage thefts' - the stories about people who had theirs stolen were endless. 
Kia (and Hyundai) are quickly climbing up the ranks as one of the most stolen car brands due to the key fob and ignition issues.

Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode.

Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated.

Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't.

Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated.

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range.

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again.",0.9727731943130493,0.5694040060043335,0.8135231733322144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.969733715057373,0.7730377912521362,0.0,0.5281561613082886,0.0,0.0,0.1729123592376709,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.

CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes.

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again.",0.9727731943130493,0.5694040060043335,0.8135231733322144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.969733715057373,0.7730377912521362,0.0,0.5281561613082886,0.0,0.0,0.1729123592376709,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go.

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range.

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again.",0.9727731943130493,0.5694040060043335,0.8135231733322144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.969733715057373,0.7730377912521362,0.0,0.5281561613082886,0.0,0.0,0.1729123592376709,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.

CX-5,KBB,Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes.

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again.",0.9727731943130493,0.5694040060043335,0.8135231733322144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.969733715057373,0.7730377912521362,0.0,0.5281561613082886,0.0,0.0,0.1729123592376709,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7386629581451416,0.0,0.995572566986084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7039179801940918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,KBB,"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range.

CX-5,KBB,"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose.",0.0,0.3507096767425537,0.0,0.48448944091796875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38532841205596924,0.601819634437561,0.0,0.0,0.8484748601913452

A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go.

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0.0,0.02457451820373535,0.24289143085479736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032758235931396484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150007724761963,0.6195892095565796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010938048362731934

CX-5,KBB,"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!",0.0,0.20965123176574707,0.0,0.0,0.929431676864624,0.0,0.0,0.6943975687026978,0.0,0.0,0.9848898649215698,0.8523067235946655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane
+250 dollar donation to Make a Wish Foundation

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle.",0.0,0.2952612638473511,0.0,0.0,0.5370482206344604,0.3120417594909668,0.0,0.1047590970993042,0.7091479301452637,0.5540616512298584,0.4181230068206787,0.0,0.0,0.29325616359710693,0.0,0.0,0.0
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K...

Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0.5473663806915283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854316711425781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8756006956100464,0.0,0.0,0.16690599918365479,0.0,0.0,0.31564855575561523,0.0

It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads.

Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane
+250 dollar donation to Make a Wish Foundation

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle.",0.0,0.2952612638473511,0.0,0.0,0.5370482206344604,0.3120417594909668,0.0,0.1047590970993042,0.7091479301452637,0.5540616512298584,0.4181230068206787,0.0,0.0,0.29325616359710693,0.0,0.0,0.0
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created.",0.0,0.08473587036132812,0.0,0.13687217235565186,0.4528242349624634,0.0,0.05166041851043701,0.2490694522857666,0.5940488576889038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39207398891448975,0.3019731044769287,0.0,0.0

Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0.5473663806915283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854316711425781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8756006956100464,0.0,0.0,0.16690599918365479,0.0,0.0,0.31564855575561523,0.0

It is sufficient for driving around town, but grossly inadequate on winding or hilly roads.

Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane
+250 dollar donation to Make a Wish Foundation

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose.

Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K... To Subaru, if you're reading this, DO something about this overly sensitive, anxiety generating, heart attack causing monstrosity you have created.",0.0,0.08473587036132812,0.0,0.13687217235565186,0.4528242349624634,0.0,0.05166041851043701,0.2490694522857666,0.5940488576889038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39207398891448975,0.3019731044769287,0.0,0.0

Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0.5473663806915283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854316711425781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8756006956100464,0.0,0.0,0.16690599918365479,0.0,0.0,0.31564855575561523,0.0

Forester,KBB,"I'm a 6'8"" 265lb male with a stocky shoulder build and I truly love this car coming out of the dealership after searching for weeks. 

PROS:
+Massive amount of front row shoulder room and head space in both driver and passenger positions
+Doors open very wide so great for loading car seats/gear/ or a 70"" tv, literally.
+Panoramic moon roof 
+Visibility is incredible, being tall, I can almost see to the very front of the car with front view angle
+Tons of storage, seriously there is a ton of room for a family with gear and even room in the spare tire department which has a foam insert to keep personal belongings separate from the tire and such so things don't take on new tire smell
+Rear hatch privacy shade to hide your goods
+Spare, tow hooks, and jack are all included. Lincolns don't have this included even and you only care when you need it so this is piece of mind
+Minimal cabin noise during highway driving, excess of 75 or really windy you can experience some wind noise but not disruptive by any means
+Suspension absorbs Michigan roads 
+All wheel drive is always on vs software enabled, (2017 Fusion AWD 2.0L EcoBoost owner), this enables the car to not slip. It snowed and was icy last night and my wife was comfortable driving 45mph while other cars crawled at 25-35mph on poor roads.
+2021 auto high beams AND steering responsive headlamps help you see into your turns better at night than the straight point and shoot kind
+33mpg combined, we got 35 driving in Ann Arbor which included 10 miles on i94
+Eyesight is great and also helps keeps the rear passengers buckled in. This car does everything but slap you if you are not being safe.
+Insurance cost increased $62 a month, (perfect driving record),  but also in part to increasing coverage options with Michigan's weird no-fault policy. 
+5 Star IHS Safety Pick, 4 star on roll over only, all else is 5 which is insane

CONS:
-6.5"" infotainment system can lag at times, also seems a tad small but very functional
-Android Auto requires a USB connection which is right under the infotainment system, with a bigger phone you need either a short cord or something long enough to run to the cup holder. Either way its just cord in your way that could've been done differently with a USB in the center console
-Mediocre power, the car drives great but you will not be aggressive to apprehend slow drivers on busy one or two lane roads
-Standard radio is just ok, no bumping, heavy metal jamming, or symphony off of the lot unless you move up a trim or package
-CVT can be rather deliberate when using Auto Start/Stop but if you like a more mechanical connection to a car as a driver, I like knowing the alternator pumps it alive fast and impactful, its like hitting a second gear nice in a stick shift.
-Premium trim does not come with BLIS standard, you certainly need this and the rubber floor mat package, (package 15)
-1.9% APR vs every other Subaru offering in December being 0%

Overall: This car is a prime example of outstanding value and safety, even after USMCA deal raised the tariffs on imports to equalize the total cost compared to say a 2020 Escape. We are a Ford family through and through but when comparing to the Escape, I had substantially more room up front being a broad man and the storage, overall front/back, and side window visibility, and ride clearance are unparalleled. This car has an inch greater ground clearance to take it through that much more terrain. I drove every Ford crossover and SUV from 2019 to 2021 model years and this car won hands down. The Ford Edge was close but I felt that I was sitting nine feet away from the front of the car and it took a lot more effort to park. The Subaru culture is also budding up which equates to the feeling of Jeep ownership with people giving you the wave and such and a pro is with a flat 4 engine that has been iterated upon since 1999, it has a low center of gravity which also explains why the front visibility is so awesome. The oil filter is literally on top of the engine too with this design so you can change oil at home easily vs a trip to the fast lane.

My final recommendation is to go with the Premium trim, opt for BLIS package and the rubber floor mats as you can cover the entire floor/hatch area/ and back seat even in thick protective rubber which is wonderful to clean compared to carpet, also comes with power rear hatch. Also opt into the 3 year Security package during the sale as you and your family can use remote start with climate control from your phones which also has anti-theft through StarLink. It is 75 dollars for 3 years compared to spending over 500 for a fob with remote start on it which you can lose. In total we got this car out the door with a 6 year 60k mile bumper to bumper warranty cheaper than a 2020 Escape with similar features and less room/storage for our lifestyle.",0.0,0.2952612638473511,0.0,0.0,0.5370482206344604,0.3120417594909668,0.0,0.1047590970993042,0.7091479301452637,0.5540616512298584,0.4181230068206787,0.0,0.0,0.29325616359710693,0.0,0.0,0.0
Forester,KBB,"We came out of a 2015 Forester XT  in Sept of 2018 to buy this thing, and have been a family of dedicated Subaru owners for about 30 years now. We have always loved our Scoobs, and then came along the new and ""freshly"" designed 2019 Forester Touring. We were very excited to see what the nice folks at Subaru had built for us. Now we are stuck with the most unliked vehicle our family has ever owned, literally... My spouse will not even drive the vehicle anymore and prefers to take the beater car (a 2006 Toyota), or just walk. The vehicle is gorgeous and still has that that great Subaru drivetrain, but that's where the fun starts and stops. The vehicle is equipped with a ""driver assistance"" suite of gadgets that makes this car an absolute NIGHTMARE to be in once the power button has been activated. The facial recognition feature works less than 50% of the time, and god forbid you be in any sort of daylight because it just turns itself on and off at a whim.  Facial recognition is tasked with knowing who you are when you enter the vehicle so the car can upload your preferences and thennnn watch you like a drunken hawk while you drive. Well, that is when it feels like it. You can expect to receive between 3 and 15 ALERTS for every trip you take. If you look at the speedometer it yells at you to keep your eyes on the road, even though you are. It will also tell you to keep your hands on the wheel, even when they already are, and so forth. Or, it won't because it turned itself off because ""reasons"". As the Pro Reviewer here wrote; the auto start/stop feature is akin to a drunkard who cannot decide which bar to enter next, it is just constantly confused about its own job, engine on or off.  If that isn't enough the EYESIGHT and myriad other ""safety"" features will bark, whine, whistle, scream, and rattle your nerves to death literally every trip. My least favorite is the overdone proximity alarms. We live in a tight urban area, so if a vehicle changes lanes in front of you, nothing crazy mind you. The EMERGENCY braking system will unload itself and smash its own brakes. This system makes the brakes sound like the front gun of an A-10 Warthog (the Air Forces Tank Buster). It literally scares the living, you know what, out of everybody inside the vehicle to the point we just all want to get out of the car and walk. The rear sensors are truly idiotic; I have a friend with an inclined driveway and I have to exit their driveway at about a 45 degree angle or the car triggers its SAFETY stop yet again, because it is too stupid to realize its a driveway not a wall, or our all time favorite the lemon grass LEAF to side of our driveway. You laugh, but it is our reminder to trim the lemon grass because if THE (singular) leaf dangles onto the driveway the Forester thinks it is the neighbors 10 year old and SMASHES on its emergency breaks. It really is ridiculous. The rear hatch has been another ""fav"" of ours... It likes to just ""lock"" itself. This has happened multiple times. It usually waits until one of us has the kids and a handful of groceries to do it, and the only way to repair it is to take it to the car dealership where the tech's have to crawl through the back doors and manually unlock the hatch door from the inside, and completely reset the vehicle. It is SOOOOO irritating. The powertrain, and I use the word power here in jest, is a joke. This thing accelerates at a glacial pace. If you need power to get out of a tough scenario it is NOT there for you in this vehicle. In fact, I cannot recall driving a more power-starved Subaru in my life. It appears to the Subaru engineers that the only option is to just stop over EVERYTHING. Well, there are many traffic scenarios where stopping is way more dangerous than getting through and/or around it. To be entirely fair, once you are on the OPEN road, the adaptive cruise control is a nice feature for road trips, the Harmon Kardon sound system is excellent, the seats are comfy, and the climate control system is second to none. We have called Subaru directly so many times at this point I can't count, and they just say the vehicle is operating as designed. If you drive other vehicles with similar features the sensitivity appears to be managed by less caffeinated individuals with more reasonable road condition parameters. If you are considering purchasing one of these, we highly recommend a thorough, overnight, even multiple day test drive so you can decide for yourself if you need or want to deal with all this nonsense. I would take my 2015 Forester XT back in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading, but I do write longer reviews when I spend $40K...

Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0.5473663806915283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854316711425781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8756006956100464,0.0,0.0,0.16690599918365479,0.0,0.0,0.31564855575561523,0.0

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list.

the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car.

after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list.

the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list. Oh, and sweet, black, 18 inch wheels too.

RAV4,KBB,"This is our 3rd RAV and 1st hybrid and we are blown away by how much this car does compared to our last 2011 Limited. The SE drives so much like our original 2008 Sport. One of the things we loved most about it. Responsive steering, different driving modes to choose from on this SE and the mileage. Amazing! 

We wanted a vehicle with cloth seats because our 2011 seats were so hard on long trips after about 2 hours. These 2022 SE seats are so comfortable. I do miss having the heated seats from the 2011 Limited, as we chose not to opt for the weather package in the SE. Not a big fan of the fact that we couldn't get something other than black/charcoal inside the SE (not great for TX summers) but the blue stitching is a very nice touch. 

We used both our 2008 and 2011 V6 RAVs to tow a boat and had no issues. Towing capacity for the SE hybrid is considerably lower so probably can't do that with this new car. But we gained a back-up camera, cross traffic alert, AWD, climate controls for the back seat (as we always take our dogs everywhere), lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something in this list.

after making the deal and driving the car home.. discovered no options from the ones i have in my 2009 LE Camry exist in the 2021 XLE RAV-4....
the trunk doesn't open from inside.. you cant remote lift trunk gate.. no rain sensing wipers.. all the basic stuff are not there and they calls it XLE.

Rogue,Edmunds,"(1/27/22 UPDATE: Living in the Northeast, we get all the wonderful elements. Safety features decided to disable themselves.  Took it down to Nissan, and the tech guy said that there is nothing they can do because Nissan developers are (his words) fucking morons for putting the sensors directly underneath the bumper. So when water, mud, snow hit it, it disables. So I said your telling me that I have safety features that are supposed to protect me and my family in the elements, but the elements prevent the safety features from working! And he said ""that is exactly what I am telling you"".) ORIGINAL POST: I have had my 2021 Nissan Rogue SV Premium Edition for 2 months now. More than half the time it has been in the shop. CVT issues strike again! 2300 miles and the SUV buckles when merging onto the highway, RPMs shoot up to 5-7 when the vehicle is at 15 mph preventing it to accelerate. If it wasn't for the quick instincts of the driver coming at me, I would have been in a horrific accident due to no acceleration coming out of a side street.

Rogue,Edmunds,"Fell in love and traded in my 2017.  This is my third Rogue and after my 2017 i was convinced never again... but I did and now regret! A couple of months ago when it was extreme cold temperatures my 2021 wouldn’t start. Would turn over but engine wouldn’t engage... first time this happened thought it was my fault cause foot slipped off break while pressing the push button start.  Waited 15 min, attempted again and it started.   A couple weeks later, happened again.  Only parked for approximately an hour, this time my foot was firmly on brake and no start!   Tried to boost, waited it out and nothing.  With only 500 km , I decided to have towed back to dealership!  Unacceptable!!! Computer scans and error after error appeared.  Now the reports are with the Nissan engineering for review and conclusion for fix. The 2021 rogue has proven to have issues with start when temperatures is -15 C and colder!  The reading suggest replace computer but results are still under review.  I have issued complaint with NIssan Canada... still waiting for conclusion.   Very concerning cause I travel daily in rural communities and winter is 6 months long with daily normal temperatures of -15 for at least 3-4 months. Caution if you live in colder climates!!!

I can't turned it off so had pulled over and stopped the engine and restart again this time the CVT malfunction light was gone but engine check light was on and can't turned it off. I called the dealer and dropped the car off for them to fix it. It was frustrated when you spent over $32k for a brand new car and only last for 120 miles and had to go to the shop.

Rogue,Edmunds,Do not buy. 2021 Nissan Rogue 23 hours old and 170.0 miles suffered catastrophic engine failure. Worst part is that Nissan left my parents who are in their 80’s on the side of the freeway in the middle of nowhere and car can’t charge phone and it’s cold and raining with semi trucks passing them and hazard lights will not work. Nissan says we are sending a truck but we are going to leave you on the side of the road and you need to call Uber or negotiate with the tow company. Nissan’s response put their lives in danger for over 4 hours. My mom and dad are terrified of this car and Nissan’s response....

Rogue,Edmunds,"According to my technician at Summerlin Nissan in Ft. Myers, FL...the possible malfunctions ""may be taken care of with the two recalls we have on your vehicle.""  My reply:  What recalls?

Antilock breaking software issues was the recall they have allegedly resolved.  After 5 hours of sitting in a waiting room.

Next issue:  Constantly being told I need an oil change.  Service light comes on with the little oil can.  Its so cute.  (Sarcasm).  Started when I first had 350 miles on the car.  Took it in.  It is properly set in the dashboard of the car, but there is something else malfunctioning causing this to again, malfunction.

Next issue:  Sonar Lane Change Blind Spot Detection shuts off at will.  No reason.  

Next Issue:  While sitting in the parking lot of a grocery store, every warning light came on in my car.  Tech told me to wipe off the sensor.  Um, which sensor and where is it located and why, after just over 1000 miles should I have to be doing this in the first place.

Called Nissan USA directly.  They told me a whole different story aside from what the service techs and manager told me.  They claim to have told them that I refused to leave the vehicle for service.  In a manner of speaking.  After waiting over 4 hours for what was supposed to have been an appointment, I had no more time and they had no loaner.  So, yes, I did refuse, but I have the text trail to prove the actual comments and the photos sent to the techs of all these screw ups.  Awaiting to hear from Nissan to see if they are going to buy this piece of tin back from me.  My first, and certainly my last, Nissan.

Rogue,Edmunds,"I recently upgraded my 2018 Rogue SV for a Rogue SV 2021. I love the new exterior design, and new safety technology. However, I failed to review the new Rogue SV features before I went to a dealership. The sales guy focused on showing me the new features and never mentioned what was taken away from the 2018 SV nor I asked for it. Now I am very disappointed that my 2018 SV had more convenient features than my 2021 SV and yet I paid more for the 2021 car. Rogue SV 2021 doesn't include:
 
Motion-Activated Liftgate -kick sensor
Power liftgate- Keyfob-opening & closing 
Blind spot sensor (alarm sound is very low)
power heated front seats
Divide-N-Hide and multi-level Cargo System
Power height-adjustable liftgate

Rogue,Edmunds,"Update!

Buyer beware. I’ve had a draining battery that needed charging. AC very lacking for a new car. Leaking drain or roof racks. Rattling in car. Nothing can ever verified or fixed. Light always coming on saying I need an oil change. Which started at 12 miles. It’s been reset more times then I can count.  But the newest problem is which first happened June 3rd and again on July 13th engine malfunction reduced power. You can’t accelerate more then 40 mph. Being told the code is gone. Seriously anyone can clear a code. The code scanned by dealership as EGR. I’m finding out this is an issue from other blocks. I can’t recommend this car at all any longer. I’m afraid of the safety concerns to my family in this car. 

The Rouge Platinum has all the safety and comfort I was looking for. I love almost everything about the car. It’s a pleasure to drive. Only drawbacks is no ventilation in seats, no height adjustment in passenger seat, no auto up and down on passenger side.These are big deals.  I love the wireless charger and wireless Apple Car Play. Digital display is beautiful and crisp and can be customized on the platinum.

Rogue,Edmunds,"I am with great disgust writing this review hoping that Nissan Canada finally does something about the defective Rogue 2021 cars.  Took a brand new Nissan out of the showroom and it malfunctioned . Called them they said bring it in and a part was ordered after 4 weeks. Took it in for inspection and replacement . I took it out again after 30 minutes while changing lanes my malfunction light went on . 
If I got into an accident while using the technology they sold me and persuaded me to get platinum , would they be responsible .
I don’t feel safe in this car , I’m paying through my nose for what piece of failed machinery . Nissan better recall the cars before something terrible happens. They just do blame game shifting responsibility between the dealership and other factors . Nissan horrible service , total disaster ,no responsibility , what kind of company is this . 
They have had multiple complaints and are still selling this dysfunctional car knowing malfunction can be hazardous to be on the road . Shame on you Nissan , entrapping  us in a lease and selling us such a car knowing it has issues abs then not recalling them nor replacing them nor cancelling our lease .

Rogue,Edmunds,right away it had transmission issues. Would not accelerate correctly at times. Happened at least five times in three months… not sure why. The RPMs shoot up and the car won’t accelerate properly. Have to turn it off and back on again and then it works. Took it in for that and the recall on the reprogramming of the ABS (got that letter days after my purchase). They did a thorough check on the car and it also needed a new battery!!! Battery was low.

Rogue,Edmunds,"I leased my 2021 Nissan Rogue AWD Premium package Feb 2, 2021 and I regret it. I have 800 miles on it, live in Ohio and the temperatures can get very cold. The remote starter is a piece of crap. It won't work until you get all the way up to vehicle. The Nissan Connect to start the vehicle isn't that great either.Thank goodness its a trial. I owned a 2018 Rouge, took it in two times out of the 31 months I owned it for issues. 

With this 2021 my first incident happened when we got extremely cold temps and snow a week of me owning. The window and windshield wipers iced up so bad I could barely see. When sitting at a light the engine will idle very high and when I pull off, you would think I'm drag racing. As my foot is on the gas pedal you can feel the vehicle decelerating instead of accelerating. A warning light had popped on and off quickly. When I took it to the dealer they asked me did a warning light come on? I said yes but it quickly went away. They seen an old code but nothing to document. Said it was low voltage light and that's probably why I feel the decelerating as its trying to pull power. Then preceded to say unfortunately Nissan's don't like the cold and not built for it. Are you kidding me!!! I've also owned a 2016 Altima and the 2018 Rogue and never had that issue.

The traction control (VDC)  is kicking on every time I go over this rail road track that's on a slight incline once I'm over it I can not accelerate because of the VDC. and it's happening when the weather is nice and the roads are not wet. This is a dangerous situation as other cars could be behind me trying to get over track before a train comes. The radio is giving me problems. As of today was playing music, received a phone call answered and the music would not play again. Could change stations, but not hear anything. After 4 minutes received another phone call, caller was very low after hanging up the music started playing again. This is my only means of transportation. This will be my last Nissan. These 3 years are going to be so long. Wish I could get out of it now. However, I don't have 15- 17K just sitting around to put with a another vehicle to eat up the negative equity.   

Update 10-8-21
Still having issues. You can feel every bump in the road. The dash on driver’s side started lifting. On the passenger side some of the panels is separating. When panoramic sunroof cover is open and you have the windows down you hear the cover flapping. 
Started hearing front end noise. The list is too long. Nice redesign. But I had enough that I was blessed to get out of it on yesterday.",0.0,0.5017358064651489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661243200302124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We have our 15 year old, clunky garage door opener attached to the nice and clean sun visor on the driver's side of our gorgeous new car.  What's up with that???  This car has everything - well almost. The 10 year old car we traded in for this new beauty had a built in garage door opener.

Rogue,Edmunds,"CONS
Major:
#1 - I purchased the top of the line package out the door at $42K, and dont get a Homelink?  
#2 - The horn is LOW. Nobody can hear us.  Had to get this replaced.
#3 - The shifters have changed where its (R-N-D) instead of (D-N-R).  That's right, there are going to be accidents for sure.  I thought I could get used to this, but I pause and do a lot thinking before I move the vehicle since my wife and I share 2 vehicles with the shifters backward.

Definitely dont understand #1, #2 #3.  Engineers must have been drunk when they finalized this.  

Annoying
#4 You will feel the road.  Noisy.  I guess its a trade off if you want to get more MPG.
#5 Tires will skid in heavy rain at 50mph on highway.  We were on a 80mph highway, went 50, and started to skid.  Car didnt feel sturdy.  Had to reduce to 30 mph.  This is less performant than my Murano.  I will change the tires after a couple of years to top of the line.
#6 Very expensive!  We paid MSRP and the dealer squeezed us an extra 2K out of us for this stupid dealer package because new cars are in high demand due to chip shortage.  Looking back, we should have went to another dealer.  But at 42K, this is way over priced for what we are getting.  I will say the 0% financing did save us a little.
#7 Navigation is incorrect at times, even the MPH, which the adaptive cruise control is based on.  Sometimes the adaptive cruise goes too fast or accelerates too fast.  Not always accurate, have to pay attention.

PROS
- Saves a lot of gas, good for local work commute.
- Love the new electronics, heads up display, steering assist and all that jazz.  It is very nice.  I think every automaker top of the line will have these.
- Seats pull back when you turn off the engine, lets you get out easier.
- Safety features
- Size good enough for my family of 4.
- Even though twice as expensive as my last car, it was actually $300 a year to insure it.  Nice surprise! I guess insurance considers all the extra safety features.

WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN?

Rogue,Edmunds,"I leased a 2021 Nissan Rogue SV and less than 24 hours after I drove it out of the dealership, a warning ⚠️ appeared ""Engin Malfunction, Reduced Power, Service Now"". Went to the dealership the next day and received BS answers one after the other. The warning has come up 7 timed in the 5 months I have had it and I have taken the car in twice now and left it so they can figure out why the warning comes on. The first time for 3 weeks and the second time for 7 weeks. To this day, they have no solution, they don't know why it happens yet they say the car is safe to drive and they release it back to me. The Willowdale Nissan Manager (Jino Park) and Salesperson (Roger Peng) ignored my emails. The Service department said there's nothing they can do and the customer satisfaction managers also care more about their own pockets than making customers happy. The issue is still not fixed and I have to continue paying for this car until the end of my lease in 3 years, which to me feels like I'm flushing my money down the toilet every month!!!

Rogue,Edmunds,"I am driving a 2018 Honda CR-V. Love it. However, it's my 2nd one. I drove a few different like vehicles and i must say other than the Mazda CX5, the Rogue was impressive. The interior in my opinion was the nicest of the bunch. Nissan did a great job. I thought it rode well and the engine power was adequate I personally felt it needed more power but for most people it is just fine. The interior makes you feel like you are in a much more expensive car. There are a few things about it that I absolutely did not like. The center console storage is a split opening like a clam shell. I hated that. I keep a lot of stuff in mine and this would drive me crazy. The opening is narrow and small making it hard to get your hand in there. The salesman said but you have a shelf underneath, well try to access that while you are driving, NOT HAPPENING. I personally do not like the side mirrors as they are angled in a funny position. These are minor things but I personally think that Nissan has a huge winner on their hands. The Rogue is one of the best looking compact SUV on the road today and i think the interior is nicer than the Mazda CX5. I think the Mazda handles the best and doesn't feel like an SUV drives like a sports car. I am probably alone in my thoughts but i do not like the Mazda knob to control the radio, HVAC and driver info center. ""IT'S DISTRACTING"" The Rogue has a ton of tech and is not annoying like the Mazda. That being said, I really like the Rogue until I got back in my 2018 Honda CR-V and drove it home. My Honda has a better ride and has better pickup on the highway. Also i like the fact that everything in my Honda is easy to see and I am not over whelmed by too many buttons and screens. But i am 63 years old and most people would consider me old but i am very tech savvy and for me, less is better inside a car. Too many distractions are a bad thing today when it comes to driving. If i did not have a Honda I probably would have bought the Rogue immediately.

Rogue,Edmunds,"This is an initial review. We bought a Boulder grey pearl 21 SL. We’ve had it for a week now. My wife loves this vehicle. It is very easy to drive, so easy, that if you turn on the pro pilot cruise it will literally drive itself. The shifter is different but only took a trip or two to get used to it.  The seats are very comfortable, it’s the most comfortable vehicle I have ever sat in. The tech is crazy good in this car and easy to understand. Nissan made it very user friendly. The features are amazing in the SL. The motion lift gate works perfectly. The storage space in the rear is comparable to our old Honda Element (with the rear seats removed) which is a huge positive. My wife does animal rescue and loves how easy it is to put cages and supplies in back. I took it grocery shopping and the divider system in rear was perfect for groceries, no sliding around issues. The rear seat is big. I’m 5’10 and our sales guy was 6’6. He was easily able to ride in the back seat behind me with plenty of knee room. The ride quality is smooth, very smooth. Like every Nissan, the engine is perky. One thing my wife loves about my 2011 Nissan Frontier is how much punch the engine has and this 4 banger Rogue doesn’t disappoint. Sport mode allows a little more punch from the engine and you can feel it in traffic. I have yet to have to refill the tank. So far, we’re averaging 34 mpg and that’s about 60% rural and 40% city driving, so impressive is a understatement. The vehicle has a massive panoramic sunroof so the interior feels huge compared to other SUVs. The information center on the car is big and easy to access. We have been using it with AppleCar play and it’s worked fine every time. The hands free options for texting or calling work great. The interior of the vehicle is not just functional, it’s a gorgeously detailed interior. Dual colors for the dash and door material. The wood grain accents really sell luxury and all the material seems very high quality especially compared to previous Nissans such as the old rogue or my old frontier. The road noise is low and I do not hear any whining from the CVT. The LED lights make a huge difference at night which my wife loves since we have to spend sometime avoiding deer and black bears on the roadways.

I called Nissan of North America and was told to take it to another Nissan dealer, a trip of over 100 miles from Andalusia.

Rogue,Edmunds,"I have had the car a little less than a week. I've been around cars all my life. Right now we have an '18 Porsche 911 we use on weekends and a '21 Lexus RX350 my girlfriend drives. This car replaced a '19 Jeep Grand Cherokee as I wanted to downsize a little.
I considered the Subaru Outback, Volvo XC60 and looked at Hondas as well as another Grand Cherokee if all else fails. As most are aware, it is very difficult even finding inventory and then when you find a car in stock it never has the trim level you want.
Overall I am happy with the Rogue but the quality control at the Tennessee plant stinks. After bringing the Rogue home I noticed two things immediately. 
1) There is a gap with the rear hatch closed. Very uncommon to see issues like this today.
2) The passenger side front and rear doors were NEVER finished at the factory. It looks like a teenager in shop class for the first day finished them. The door skins came off the cutter and then wrap around the inside of the door top and bottom. On this car you can see where the metal came off the cutter and it looks like a piece of aluminum foil you cut from a roll. It is then supposed to be filled in and painted. It never was. The driver's side is fine. The passenger side just had some paint slapped on it. How does a car leave the plant with these glaring issues?
I hold the plant manager responsible and the QC team. Just shoddy workmanship. Period.
The car rides OK but it is a stiff ride with the 19"" wheels/tires. You will feel every imperfection in the road. And be aware of the tire pressure. 33 front, 30 rear.
Wind noise is noticeable even at lower speeds.
You have to go up to the Platinum model to get side sensors which we had on the Jeep. I did not want the Platinum model because I don't want ""quilted"" seats.
As noted by reviewers online the Bose sound system is really subpar. You hear the small left and right side pillar speakers and that's about it. It may well be the worst sound system I have heard in many years. And who puts a subwoofer next to the spare tire well and then covers it? Ridiculous.
Having only a few hundred miles on it I hope I don't run into some of the issues I have read here in the reviews. Subaru, Honda and others are using the CVT transmissions so one would think they are sorted out. 
One a positive note I will say that there is a nice paint job on it and with the exception of what I noted above the build quality is good. That may sound like an oxymoron but the defects are quite noticeable. It also does not have an AGM battery. If you have a car with Auto start/stop you have an AGM battery. I know. Jeep replaced THREE of them in a TWO year period. Not only are they expensive but they require a technician to calibrate everything when it's installed. About $235+ for the battery and $125+ for labor/calibration. Fair warning, DON""T get a car with the Auto Start/Stop if you plan on keeping it past the warranty period. Even if they cover the battery, they DON""T cover the calibration. 
The a/c takes a little while to get cold and the engine takes a little longer to come up to temp than I am accustomed to but both are livable. 
I have read the reviews here as well as owners' reviews on other brands. Every brand/model has their good and bad points. 
The bottom line is;
Would I get another Nissan? 
I will say I regret not waiting a few more months as Jeep and some other brands of interest are coming out with all new models.",0.8461517095565796,0.051213622093200684,0.7936949729919434,0.8314622640609741,0.0,0.0,0.3913407325744629,0.4272409677505493,0.8128907680511475,0.12551474571228027,0.8753587007522583,0.4376661777496338,0.34855592250823975,0.0,0.0,0.65848708152771,0.8058239221572876

Rogue,Edmunds,Well I haven’t purchased the rogue yet but I do test drive it ! My husband and I test drove a Kia Sorento it was nice . We are trying to really take time and make sure we get one that’s right for the family he has a new Chevy truck! So we decided to test a few out that rated well ! So we had to drive to Jamestown NY. Since there’s no Nissan dealer near us in Pennsylvania! There’s one in Hornel NY. But we decided to go to Jamestown those two were the closest. Well we loved the Rogue everything about it ! The looks and the feel . Room is spacious! I’m surprised the one guy wrote he was 6 ft 1 talk and 240 lbs and was cramped because I’ve watched you tube videos on it and the one guy was 6 ft 1 or 2 and he said he was around 240 or 250 those were his words in the video he fit just fine with plenty of room he did adjust the steering wheel so it came out more ! But I know some people say it’s not speedy but I found it fun to me and my husband it’s beautiful that’s for sure and very solid ! I already have everything picked out for it once we test drive a few more ! To see  Honda we haven’t yet or Toyota  and Hyundai ! That will be it !! But I did look them all up and the Nissan looks so much better but my husband said I just can’t go by looks well I said you can by comfort cuz I honestly don’t know how the others are going to beat the rogue on that !!!

The driving assistance made the car almost dangerous to drive- the laning assistance made it hard to change lanes, and collision detection system made it hard to pass slow vehicles.
The cruise control doesn't work without the collision detection- and the collision detection doesn't work when it rains or snows. So no cruise control, no radio, GPS, reverse camera.

Rogue,Edmunds,"This Nissan model is plagued with transmisssion problems, which are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit. 

I bought my 2021 Rogue in December 2020 and it has been in the shop 4 times since May 20211. When I climb the steep hill to my house and push the STOP button, the SUV makes a terrifying clunk of metal on metal and lunges forward! It doesn't normally do this on flat land, but will once in a while.

The Nissan dealer service center (I've been to 3 different ones) claim they don't see the problem--there's no problem if they can't recreate it, mind you. Well, all dealerships are on flat land, not a mountaintop! 

I've contacted Nissan Corporate about their supposed Buy Back Program and was told that I have 2 years left on my manufacturer's warranty and they are just sure it will be addressed in that timeframe. 

There are not many negative reviews for this SUV out there, but I suspect most owners don't drive a 30-degree incline 4x a day, so they may not experience the same problem. 

Though the interior is lovely, cabin technology is current, passenger and cargo space is generous, and handling is good, I still DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SUV BECAUSE OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. I suspect that if I kept it, I'll be sinking thousands into continuous trips to the service center---which will all result in ""we don't see a problem.""

Rogue,Edmunds,"After two years with my 2019 Rouge SV, I decided it was time to step it up in terms of interior quality and performance, I've been a fan of Nissan's for awhile now and when I purchased my 19 it was disappointing that Nissan rehashed the same design yet again, however with the new Rouge it's got a love it or hate it personality to it. My review will be talking about the Platinum version. In my opinion, I REALLY wish Nissan offered a better engine for this year. It's got more power and more ""umph!) then the previous year.. but I think they could have thrown in an engine that delivered my HP and more torque to the wheels, however with that said.. I'd gladly that what they offered anyday vs. the previous model. 

Interior quality is great, the wireless charger pad I wish was bigger. Nissan forgets that there are phones larger than 6.7 inches now, a bigger pad would have been appreciated. The dash is excellent. It's perfect, it's OLED display and since I'm a tech nerd, I love it. It's bright, clear and the heads up display is.. okay. It's a nice feature to have. After a software update wireless apple carplay was offered which is great and has just a hare of lag when switching songs.

Rogue,Edmunds,"The 2WD SV is my company car... It does everything this kind of vehicle should do. Before this I had a 2014 Ford Escape Titanium which I owned.  Here is how it compares to the escape:

Tech features:
It's not fair to compared a 2014 to a 2021 model, and I'm sure Ford offers some of this in the new Escape, but here is what I like about the Rouge: 
Pro pilot assist- I dig it.  It allows me to devote some of the attention I would have paid to making sure I was centered in my lane and watching the break lights of the vehicle in front of me to looking further up the road to plan which lane I need to be in to get to my exit or avoid slow-downs.  

The 360 degree camera-  I like it.  Very helpful for parking.

Android Auto- most Auto manufacturer Nav systems suck anyway.  All I really want is to have my Google maps from my phone on a bigger screen where I can see it without looking down at my phone, Great!

The stereo- Not as good as the premium system in the Escape, but unless you're a bass-head there's no reason one can't enjoy listening to music on the road with this system.

Interior: It feels kind of fancy. its got a lot of stitching and leather-ish looking surfaces. on the dash and doors. The Cloth upholstery feels soft and durable at the same time, and looks good. 
The cargo space seems more usable than the Escape.  I have an easier time loading bikes and other large objects in the Rouge than in the escape. I don't know if it has more cargo space or it's just the shape.

Driving:  Both the Rouge and the Escape handle admirably well for a Crossover, they're pretty much equal as far as handling goes. My Escape had a 2.0 liter turbo charged engine, but I test drove the 1.6.  Both accelerated better than the Rouge.  The 2.0 Escape had a lot more power. The 1.6 was similar in terms of horse power, but felt a lot faster due to the torque band of the turbo charger and the transmission.  The Rouge just isn't good in terms of power, and the way the CVT delivers it.  The paddles they put on the steering column so I can pretend to shift like a big boy are just an insult to my intelligence, don't placate me like a child Nissan!
The Rouge is efficient for it's size, but I suspect they could have greatly improved the driving experience  by offering a smaller engine with a Turbo and an 8 or 10 speed automatic transmission with only marginal impact on MPG. 

Conclusion: It's a nice, comfortable car that is easy to drive & live with.  I think where they chose to save money to undercut the competition on price was to neglect the power-train... probably not a bad business decision because most of their target market will never push hard enough on the gas pedal on the way to soccer practice or the grocery store to notice the difference. Personally, I like it for a work vehicle someone else is paying for, but if it were my own money, I wouldn't by a CVT unless it were attached to a hybrid power-train like in the Ford Maverick or Subaru Crosstreck to really save some gas, Either that or if you prefer power, a regular transmission with a turbo-charged engine.  All this CVT for efficiency nonsense is a lazy half measure.",0.28661608695983887,0.37948012351989746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6106916666030884,0.4240189790725708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3043407201766968,0.0,0.0,0.0

Rogue,Edmunds,"I bought my 2021 Nissan Rogue in December of 2021, it is now April 2022. It drives nice an has decent road manners however, acceleration is poor unless the vehicle is in sport mode. When driving down the highway in sport mode it has difficulty finding a gear that it’s happy which and the RPMs shoot up between 5000 & 7000 and just maintains there until you shift back to normal drive mode. Fuel economy is great much better than my previous Armada, I average about 28mpg (I have a lead foot). Interior quality for the SV trim with premium package is really nice and has great looking materials and finishes, the only complaint with the interior is the shift knob. I can shift the knob just fine but the Park button on top is already fading. I understand as things age they fade and discolor but the car is only 4 months old. Wish the vehicle had wireless apple car play and android auto, seems dated to have to plug the phone in. I consider this vehicle to be tough, it currently has almost 7000 miles on it and haven’t had any issue other than the above stated transmission/acceleration issues.

Escape,Edmunds,"Considered the Honda CRV but chose the redesigned Escape titanium version instead.  Liked the stronger 250 hp engine and its traditional transmission versus CVT in the Honda.  The tech features (nav, HUD, app, safety) are significantly newer and at 6' tall I seemed to have a bit more leg room in the cockpit.  I also really liked the panoramic sunroof option and a bit more comfortable seats.  The car seems significantly more refined than the older generation CRV to me and the color and wheel choices appealed more to me.  I love the antimatter blue.  Negatives:  In higher trim levels the Ford appears at least 10% more expensive than the Honda (apples to apples) and it's historical resale value is poorer as well.  The Ford's interior is also not real impressive, seat materials even at the highest trim level (titanium elite) are cheap and hard plastics abound.  Most upper level configurations end with a black interior, no grays are offered.

Escape,Edmunds,"After trading in my lease early with my 2019 Ford Edge, which we loved the 2021 Escape is horrible. 
 
I hear a significant flapping and thumping noise that sounds like it comes mostly from the right rear wheel area and to a slightly lesser degree across the entire rear of the vehicle. It is a concussion type of noise and I don’t hear it when the windows are down. It does not record well, but passengers tell me it is more prominent when they are in the back seat area than when in the from seat. It is more noticeable on smooth roads as bumps and rough pavement is loud enough to mask the flapping.
The dealership reported a loose screw on the front was replaced, but the noise did not abate. I have crawled underneath and do not see anything loose, but the material the wheel wells are made of is extremely pliable and is not attached to anything structural on the back side of the tire. The rear bumper is also very flexible and has nothing rigid to attach to on the lower part of the bumper. I can flex and fold these materials easily and when “thumbed” they make a similar flappy type noise as I hear while driving at speeds over 45 and under 65.

Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"So far I’m loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It’s a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I’m not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven’t seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I’m not crazy about, it is the “Auto-Stop” function that shuts down the car at lights. I’m really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven’t used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I’ve mostly stayed in “standard” mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I’m not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles.

Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Just had the opportunity to drive the Badland edition, and I really liked it. I immediately dismissed it previously as a rebadged Escape, but I was surprised. Firstly, very good driving experience. The engine has good power, the steering has good feedback and great on-center feel, and it's refined. It felt really solid, and I was not expecting that at all. On the highway, I caught myself going over the speed limit many times due to its refinement. Comfortable interior, and really powerful heating/heated seats. I just really loved how solid it felt going down the road. The AWD system is really good! Turning off the stability control, it was really easy to get rotation in the snow.  I had to drive it to the airport during a snow storm, and it felt so stable on the highway!!! The headlights are really good! Really, I wasn't expecting to like it so much since I drove a new Escape and it felt really different. I liked the stiff ride, as it imparted a solid feel to the vehicle. The driving position is great, and it looks great in person. Like a mini LR Defender. The sculpted hood is really cool to look at when driving. Lastly, I loved the size of it. Truly maneuverable and agile. In terms of downsides, the 2.0T seemed to really eat gas. Probably because of the aerodynamics and the good performance. Also, the speakers were truly mediocre. There was a very obvious rattle under heavy bass. Overall, I'd really recommend it. It's priced higher than other subcompact SUVs, but it truly feels more expensive due to its solidity, good performance, and solid driving dynamics. I'm a fan!

The interior seating is comfortable on long trips.  The back seats have limited space but are functional.  It has plenty of storage in the back which expands when the back seats are put down.  I have had no issues at all and just completed my first oil change.  The Badlands comes with a front facing camera that I use when parking to ensure I am where I need to be.  The front camera comes on automatically when engaging Rock Crawl, Mud/Ruts, or Sand mode.  It comes with Ford Co-Pilot 360 and Automatic High Beams which is very nice-automatically going to high beam and switching back with oncoming traffic.  The Co-Pilot 360 takes a bit to get used to if you have never used it before with the lane assist/centering, blind spot alerts, and pre-collision assist but it is very nice and provides for additional safety.

Bronco Sport,Edmunds,I have had my vehicle for 3 months. So far the main screen behind the steering wheel goes completely blank. Unable to show mph etc. However after turning on and off several times it does eventually come back. Also I was just driving down the road and the rear glass window exploded. I thought someone may have thrown something at it but no one was around. Very scary! I have been advised of a recall as well with the gas line which I inquired about and a Ford Dealership said to come back they have not been provided the part to fix it with yet. 😔😔,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"I love the looks.  I love the size.  I love the exterior and the interior.    I previously had two Ford Escapes and knew the Escape platform was the basis for the Bronco Sport.   BUT...I should have examined the bronco more closely, and if you're thinks of buying one, so should you.  The driver's seat is too low, even at its maximum.  And worse....I would even say dangerous...the gas pedal is further away , and much smaller, than the break pedal.  So if you practice heel/ toe driving, you will find that if you position your heel so as to use the brake, only your toes will reach the gas.  In fact, your foot can easily slide off the gas pedal altogether, and could conceivably slip UNDER.  And conversely, if you position your foot to rest properly and effectively on the gas pedal, you may have to lift your leg or slide your foot back to apply the brake.

Bronco Sport,Edmunds,"Everyone’s needs are different and for me, Bronco Sport Outer Banks is excellent “dog mom” little SUV. It also helped that my experiences with George Coleman Ford in Travelers Rest, SC made it particularly stress-free (I haven’t bought a brand new car from a dealership in many years, so I was leery). It’s nice interacting with people that don’t use high-pressure tactics and that honor their words (thanks Chase and Gerald!). I’m still discovering little “bells and whistles” everyday that I didn’t realize I wanted or needed (like auto sensing on/off of high beams). The temps are cooling quickly and I live in the country, so things like remote start and remembering your climate settings (heated seats, steering wheel) all really nice in the morning for doggie day care drop-off.  My Bronco handles my 1/4 mile gravel driveway (obscured with leaves in some sections) with ease - happily takes on mountain roads and switchbacks with ease.

CR-V,Edmunds,"The CRV feels like a small car, not an SUV. The engine is loud and the transmission is pretty rough when you are stepping on the peddle and accelerating quickly. We.were very surprised how poorly this car handles in the snow. The biggest issues we have had are with the interior and the overall technology. First this vehicle is not able to utilize the Honda app for remote start, or to lock the vehicle. The Honda app is actually a pay subscription service. The screen and controls also look grainy and like they have not been updated in many years. The screen feels and looks antiquated. The number one issue is the incredibly intrusive dashboard that comes to a point between the front seats. Storage is not convenient and the front seat is not comfortable for tall riders.

I've brought this car to two dealerships for help. I hate my CRV because of the way it shifts from braking to gas. When I take my foot off the brake as in at a stoplight, it makes a heavy clunking shift feel and sometimes lurches. To drive the car, one should feel nothing between the shifting of brake to gas pedal. The dealerships say it's a normal feel because of the auto engine idle. I think is either a flaw of the car, or I've got a lemon. I wanted this roomy vehicle to carry bikes and passengers. Also, the heated leather seats barely heat up.

CR-V,Edmunds,"There is a national car shortage of new cars and most dealers will laugh when presented with advertised lease specials.  We had a 2009 Honda Accord EX-L which had been mostly rock solid and had 129,000 miles, mostly trouble free.  One Saturday I took it in for a scheduled oil change.  The dealer is literally within eyesight of my house.  While there I strolled around and was shocked to see only one new vehicle in the showroom. The front lot was full of used cars for the most part.  I then observed a 2021 CRV EX-L AWD in Sonic Pearl Gray.  The dealer had 2 grand of add ons plastered on.  I started talking to a salesman and the story was a lady had ordered it and didn't like the color upon seeing it on the lot.  It had 10 miles on it and it was the only CRV they had. On impulse alone  I told the salesman to write up a lease based on their loaded sticker.  So I paid a few bucks over list and I don't care.  It's the way things are at the moment. Two days later I sold the 2099 Accord to the first person who came to look at it.   The CRV is a good, solid reliable vehicle with many good features.  And decent gas mileage.  I also have another vehicle with a 250 HP V8 and I like the acceleration of the CRV.  It isn't a Lexus nor is it meant to be. The leather interior is comfortable,  passable  and fine for everyday use.  There is plenty of room in the rear for storage.  I like the power rear gate.  The turbo engine is more than adequate.  The stop/go feature is annoying but easily disabled.  We plan on keeping Sirius.  The sound system is above average.    In short, it's the first new car I have  bought in over 50 years and I'm impressed with the fit and finish.  It's quiet enough for me and both my wife and I enjoy driving it.  Love the memory seat function although I also have it on the other car this one is more accurate.  We leased it for 3 years and at that point we will decide to buy or lease again.   In the meantime I am looking for a dealer who will give me a Pilot for the advertised lease price from corporate Honda.  Maybe in a couple of months.  For now, we have the CRV and we're satisfied.   

Update. April 2022. After 6 months we have put 4,000 miles on the vehicle.  The memory seats are very handy  Mileage for our shorts trips is about 18 MPG   The occasional highwayvtrip is in excess of 30.  It's a smooth car we like it.

A noticed that the car shakes when driving on the highway.

I thought something fell off and my car was going to break. A few moments after panicking, I thought to put the windows up and that was that. It was scary, and now I drive more aware and I am thinking that this car is too light.

Tucson,Edmunds,I traded my 2020 Sonata in for a Tucson value. I needed an SUV for practicality and health reasons.. all I can say is I’m very happy with Tucson Value I bought.comfortable and quiet ride. Easy to get in and out of and good storage. I thought performance and fuel consumption would be a down side of buying this car. Fuel consumption on a long highway run doing around 80 mph was just over 34 mpg. About 30 mpg running around locally. So better than I anticipated. Performance wise. It’s adequate and if you need more zip I can select Sport mode.

Sportage,Edmunds,"2021 Kia Sportage SX Turbo, Pacific Blue with Beige interior package (really tan with charcoal edges, HOT! It has every smart safety upgrade, including the fact it can park itself either by backing into a slop or parallel. And then it can unpark itself. It has lane departure, but also will keep one in the lane utilizing adaptive cruise control as you go. Front and back avoidance and braking functions for the unexpected. On and on I could go. I agree with the other reviews about the interior and of course the spectacular panoramic roof (one touch). The glass all around is tinted fading to a lighter tint in front. The roof is tinted, doesn't glare as light pores in, feels cool and refreshing. The SPORT mode in driving as the Turbo to break out of the cage and be the tiger it is. Otherwise NORMAL and ECO modes feel just fine, more than enough power. While it may not be the very top it certainly comes in nice enough. Consider the paddle shifters on the back side of the steering wheel as a case in point, so VERY EASY to use. Infosys allows for every contingency in multiple ways to access. The adaptive cruise control drives, brakes, and adapts to the flow without a hitch, a major relief in itself. The lack of memory for the seats is a bummer but I can live with it. Even the thickness of the steering wheel feels just right. Easy vehicle to drive. 19"" tires lend a sense of security and handling wherever I go. The back cargo space has a spare tire and other space when you lift the lid for storage. It also drops in the event of a taller than normal box. This is a keeper. I wouldn't get the AWD unless I needed it. The mileage is better around town than I expected, 24.5 mpg average. Max they say is 28 mpg on the Hwy. I wonder with adaptive cruise control it won't be better than that (slightly - maybe 30 mpg.)",0.0,0.6791839599609375,0.947953462600708,0.0,0.9229843616485596,0.0,0.8082536458969116,0.0,0.9796342849731445,0.9851654767990112,0.9675177335739136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4495229721069336,0.0,0.0

Sportage,Edmunds,"I supposed to get the 2021 Mazda CX5 but there was a problem in the approval of my loan documents, so I decided to go to my 2nd choice which is the Kia Sportage. I am only looking for an AWD option due to my hobby of going to some small adventure for desert and seashores in the small Country of Qatar. I picked the mid option which was having the AWD but when I finally collected the car, it was like a huge bomb dropped in front of me. I side mirrors, open when I get close to the car, and I can start the engine in as far as 10 meters from the vehicle. Going inside is just a press of a button and a push button start. There is a auto dimming rear view mirrors and a full roof of glass sun roof which can be physically opened halfway. Off road modes also present as I saw the center locking differential button and the hill descend control. Infotainment doesn't represent any branding but the sound is still top notch. Both driver set and front passenger set are electric adjustable only lumbar is added in the driver set. The inside cabin design is two toned  and very luxurious feel. Hand brakes are not electronic since its actually a foot brake but I didn't bother. The package also comes with a standard spare tire and aluminum wheel. Sets are very comfortable specially with the addition of the rear ac vents. Cabin is very quiet only you can hear the engine growl from 2000 rpm and higher. Steering is very good just a small indirect feeling but its not very noticeable not unless you have driven a Mazda CX5 for a long time. Setting position is very commanding and sets are perfect and very comfortable. Only I can say is, that this option is very close to the full option. The followings items are the only things making the gap being full a full option (adaptive cruise control, lane departure and lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert and stopping, electronic parking brake, paddle shifters, wireless phone charger, blind sport monitor, LED headlight, 19 inch wheel, power lift gate and full leather sets.

Sportage,Edmunds,"In general I'm a huge proponent of Korean manufacturers and all the strides they've made over the last 10 years or so. There's clear evidence of major improvements across various platforms, and investment into design and development across the entire Genesis / Hyundai / Kia lineup. 
I'll start with the good. The Sportage is a very unique looking car and is certainly not for everyone. But for those that appreciate its uniqueness, it's a wonder to look at and drive. Kia openly advertises the fact that its latest design includes components inspired by the Porsche Macan. My test drive experience of the fully loaded SX model resulted in an overall pleasant experience. I was amazed with the quality of interior, excellent heated & ventilated seats, the glass roof with a huge opening moon roof panel, the sound system, the intuitive entertainment and navigation, and the power train - the 2.0L performed wonderfully and never left me wanting more throughout its range on local streets and the highway. Nice Michelin tires were originally included with the car. One negative stood out right away - the road noise. But I was willing to live with it given all the positives. I bought the car and overall, with the exception of road noise and few corks around I still enjoy the drive a year and a half later. My FWD SX Turbo model gets me 26MPG average in an approximate 70/30 highway/local split, which isn't the greatest in its class but is respectable given the power and the cargo room it offers. The Sportage is one of those cars that's much bigger on the inside than out. It's very roomy. Most passengers can't believe how roomy and well appointed the interior is after seeing the exterior. Now on to the cons....
The Kia Sportage is the longest running model within Kia's lineup, so buying the 2021 top of the line SX trim I expected it to be completely refined with any potential issues ironed out. That was not the case, not even close. Instead, I've been having issues and non-stop dealer visits since day one. Out of the gate, day 1, the alignment was off and the car pulled to the left constantly while driving - unacceptable from a brand new vehicle and has never happened to me before (I purchased 18 brand new vehicles so far in my life). The infotainment head unit stopped working with Navigation just hanging endlessly if you try to put in an address. The head unit had to be replaced within 2 months of driving since new. There were few other body panel and door latch issues. The driver's door had to be slammed to actually latch closed. The weirdest issue by far, and the one that still haunts the car every few months and requires a dealer visit for some patch work, is the loud whistle at 50MPH coming from the left fender where the bumper seem meets the left fender. Issue occurred day one, and was in fact a LOUD whistle, I'm not exaggerating, that can be heard through music in side the vehicle and results in the most annoying drive experience you can imagine. After several dealer visits and them eventually involving Kia corporate engineers, the fix was put in place - some foaming insulation poured into the seem to fill in the gap and stop the whistle. It worked for few months until AZ heat caused the glue to separate and the panel to completely come off. The whole bumper had to then be replaced by the dealer (another week in the shop). Once replaced, the issue came back with vengeance! The seem had to be jammed open and more insulation foam went in. It's holding for now. The vehicle is about a year and a half old and it's been in the shop at least a month so far. I wish Kia included the memory driver's seat feature, at least in top trim models. We have 3 drivers in the household and constant manual adjustments are needed. I've had much cheaper vehicles that include the feature. The road noise gets worse with tire wear. I notice it more and more and it is noticed by most passengers that have experienced the competition, something like a CR-V, the CX-5 or the RAV4. Having had multiple Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia vehicles, I can say with fair certainty that the undercarriage insulation is only done correctly in their Genesis lineup. Kia and Hyundai are insulated in a minimalist fashion to save on weight and costs. My G80 was whisper quiet on the road. But then again, it cost twice as much as the Sportage. One more and final big gripe is the dealer experience. The facility, the staff, the very obvious lack of training in all areas are seriously getting to me. I dread each visit these days, even for regular maintenance. I often find myself having to tell the service specialist what to do to fix a given issue. In summary, I feel like the Sportage, being one of the oldest models in the company's lineup, could have used a little more quality control and attention to detail in its manufacturing process. This could have been a great seller and competitor, but instead falls short in areas that are actually fairly simple to address.",0.0,0.1399604082107544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4302175045013428,0.5019775629043579,0.0,0.0,0.1476658582687378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06659448146820068

CX-5,Edmunds,"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are now a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety and tech features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily used without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn’t as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff – which we don’t.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content – if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.  
We are very happy with our new CX-5.",0.8179467916488647,0.0,0.8691819906234741,0.0,0.9749343395233154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8725484609603882,0.9220641851425171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
CX-5,Edmunds,"I just brought home a '21 Signature after owning a 2016 GT for the past 5 years and could not be happier. Mazda's approach seems to be continuous refinement which is apparent in this iteration. My priorities were driving experience--handling, ride, power, AWD snow performance--and also luxury. MPG, minor off-road capability, and cargo space were down the list. Although exterior styling is refined rather than aggressive (see the RAV4), the overall aesthetic remains appealing and the interior is at a near-luxury level. I test drove the '21 RAV4 and it drives ok but simply can't compete with CX-5 (IMO). Although if a person plans to keep a vehicle for 15 years it is hard to beat Toyota's track record.

The Bose system is impressive and the ability to adjust it to individual listening preferences is noteworthy. The new infotainment system has improved significantly over the past 5 years and I am an enthusiastic convert to the no-touch screen and console commander control wheel. The screen resolution and user interface reflect a major evolutionary improvement that was easy to learn based on prior experience. Interior surfaces and design are refined and although some reviewers complain about the lack of a panoramic roof, that was a non-issue for me as I rarely use the existing moon roof. 

My non-turbo 2016 GT was engaging and fun to drive and the '21 Signature takes these characteristics to a new level. I've had it in 4-6"" of snow and it performs very well, even with the all-season OEM Toyo A36s. I was surprised, and hopeful, that they will perform better than the A23s that came on the 2016 GT. Curvy canyon roads elicit a spontaneous smile in any weather--sun to snow.

This Signature is only my second Mazda; previously I owned multiple Subarus (Outback) and a couple Toyota Highlanders. These are great vehicles, but I've now been spoiled by Mazda. I've rented a number of compact SUVs over the past few years ranging from Jeeps to Nissans and Chevy/Fords and none impressed me like Mazdas. I did look briefly at the CX-9 but didn't need the 3rd row. 

The CX-5 Signature checks off all my boxes. Improved Mazda reliability noted by consumer groups is a nice plus and I suspect this reflects their focus on refining, improving, and tweaking existing proven technology (engines, transmission) rather than jumping to the next new thing (e.g., CVTs—ughh). Their turbo has been out for several years and I am hopeful it will hold up well while helping to make the driving experience an absolute pleasure. Turbo lag is minimal, and I suspect that as I learn the throttle characteristics, it will be rare. I think that the Mazda CX-5 is a great and underappreciated (based on sales) vehicle.",0.986196756362915,0.0,0.8166087865829468,0.9428107738494873,0.9610779285430908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.996246337890625,0.9548043012619019,0.992529034614563,0.7858908176422119,0.0,0.852563738822937,0.0,0.07137787342071533,0.0
CX-5,Edmunds,"This car lives up to its billing.

CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my 2021 Signature CX-5 for 2 months now and am thrilled with my purchase. Having owned a 2009 Mazda6 in the past, I expected excellent handling and this vehicle delivers. The steering is quick and accurate with the suspension providing a firm and controlled, but not harsh, ride which I find comfortable and reassuring. The turbo is definitely a good addition to the standard engine. While not a race car, the acceleration is linear with minimal turbo-lag and more than enough from either a standing start or for passing on the freeway.

The interior is very driver friendly and near-luxury. The driver's seat is comfortable and easily adjustable. The cabin is quiet enough for conversation at normal volume even at highway speeds. The 10 inch screen is well placed so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to view. I am not a fan of using a touch screen while driving so I appreciate the control wheel and push button controls which are easy and intuitive to use. I thought having Apple CarPlay/Android Auto was a ""must-have"" for my new vehicle, however I've found that I rarely use the feature since I actually prefer navigating with the Mazda system over Google Maps and usually listen to subscription satellite radio.

Having come from a larger 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5 is a great CUV that fit within my current budget. Its ride is a bit on the firm side, which will take time getting used to, after having the smooth ride of the 9. The non-turbo engine, however, is peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The larger 10.25"" info screen is also really great. The one feature that falls terribly short, in my opinion, is the Bose stereo. The sound, even with the treble at its highest setting, sounds muddy and muffled, and doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose systems in the 9, the new 3's and the very new CX-30. Being in year five of its current generation, the 5 would benefit GREATLY from the same Bose 12-speaker system found in the new 3 and CX-30.

I have driven the car about 100 miles so far and it handles great.  My wife on the other hand is still getting used to the handling.  Her last car was a Ford Fusion which had a much different ride. She just needs to drive it more to get used to the different handling.  I have a Chevy Traverse which has a similar ride but softer because its a larger vehicle.

I purchased a white one in the Grand Touring Reserve trim and it has everything I could ever need. The build quality on literally everything is superb. The one issue I have with it, is in how the stereo system is controlled. There is no way to easily switch through my favorited XM stations without taking my eyes off the road and going through multiple actions on the console control system. Oddly enough, there is a way to semi-easily flip through the 100+ other stations that I don't listen to. Both the Mazda3 and the CX-30 have functionality on the volume knob that allows for switching through your favorites by pressing left or right, but when you pay more money for the CX-5, this isn't included.

CX-5,Edmunds,"The Mazda CX-5 is a nice SUV as all the reviews agree, but it's not for everyone. The sporty image Mazda is striving for results in heavily bolstered front seats that are not comfortable for everyone.

We went looking for the lower priced way to get the turbo, but dealers are treating the Carbon edition like it's already turned into a diamond, adding $5000 to the sticker plus the phoney alarm for $1300 and the Scotch tape on the door edges for $399.

CX-5,Edmunds,"At 55, after buying Fords, a Maserati, and two Nissans and having driven Hondas, Toyotas and several sports cars and SUVs, I purchased my first Mazda based on commercial site reviews.  Looking for safety, reliability, and a great price with a loaded car.  Wanted to down size.  Thought I had found it in the CX-5. My test drive was short. My fault. Because I realized after driving the CX-5 the first day I bought it that that the front seats are beyond terrible. If you are over about 50 or have shoulder or back problems, avoid this car. The seats will make you suffer. We just got back from a 5 hour both ways vacation drive with less than 150 miles on the car starting out and by the time we got back we want to sell it even for a loss. Our backs and shoulders ached the whole time. The seats are so stiff, have no leg room support, and are so ergonomically painful, that no engineer who designed the seats could have driven any time in them or is a moron. We have since researched seat issues with this car and unfortunately  now know that this is a huge issue with this car. Hard to believe that a car company could design a beautiful, highly equipped, reliable and safe car that is ruined by its horrible car seats.

CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my Signature now for about 6 months and have put 10k miles on it (runs between NC and MA).

First, a shoutout to Edmunds Mazda leasing information person who responded quickly to my request.  Got it just before going into the dealership and shamed them into rolling back the 3x lease rate they wanted initially.  Great info, and wonderful responsiveness!

I had resisted going the SUV route for a long time, but the sporting drivability of this vehicle has won me over.  I love to power into corners and feel the rear-wheel steering adjustment improve the tracking is wonderful.  And yes, the suspension is stiffer than some people like, but it also improves the driving experience for me.  Take a spirited test drive if you're not sure.

Coming from an Infiniti Q50, I still miss rear-wheel drive acceleration on occasion, but it looks like the CX-5 (CX-50) will have that when my lease is up so I can live with this quibble for now.  And although the CX-5 doesn't have all the luxury bells of the Infiniti, I still love getting 90% of it at 65% of the price!

Another ding is space, for people and for storage.  I have not had any complaints about people feeling like there's not enough room for them, so not a problem for me.  I will admit to occasionally wishing for a few more inches of storage space though.  I can work through it by reclining the front passenger seat though, so no showstoppers yet on the storage side.

Fit and finish are very well done.  I wasn't sure initially about the Caturra leather being the only seating option (brown?), but it's such a rich color I love it.  Ergonomically, I would wish for more aggressively bolstered seats, but my friends all think the seats function great from their perspectives.

The non-touch screen required only a short acclimation period; the controls in the center console are easy to find by touch and then get to navigation, entertainment, or communications.  I'll grouse about my inability to use voice controls effectively, but it's most likely me.

CX-5,Edmunds,"Owning a Honda Pilot for 9 years, I knew it was too big and thirsty for my current needs. But I was concerned about feeling cramped in a compact CUV. No worries there. The CX-5 was extremely comfortable, well-appointed, and packed with features for the price. I test drove a Carbon Turbo and a Touring preferred pkg at my first dealership. I had seen reviews say the base engine was a bit weak, but I found the regular engine to have plenty of pep and power. In fact, because of traffic, I didn't get to really open the turbo up during the test drive. I realized with my driving patterns, I really wouldn't have much need for the Turbo. 

The Carbon Edition is basically the Touring trim with the SV Preferred package items and some trim items unique to this level. Including a paint color called Polymetal Grey, which is actually a very sharp steely blue. It also has a different grill, black wheels, black trim around the wheel wells. On the interior, the black leather seats are accented with red stitching. A red interior is also available, which I though would look horrid, but actually looks pretty sweet in person.

As good as the car looks, it's also fun to drive. Very responsive and handles well. Loaded with safety and convenience features that make driving a pleasure. 

As I said in the title, I drove the CX-5 first, but wanted to see what else was out there. Anything else I drove just left me flat. Wasn't even close. So the CX-5 it was.

CX-5,Edmunds,"Purchased a new 2021 Grand Touring w/Premium Pkg. Dark Blue w/black leather. It's FWD and non-turbo which is perfect for our driving style and region. The engine is plenty peppy and the 6 speed auto shifts like perfection. The interior is very luxurious. Heated and cooled seats. Bose stereo. Heads up display feels like you're driving a Vette. Memory seats which is great since me & my spouse both use the car and ratcheting the drivers seat manually in our old car was a pain. Now we just push a button. Wife likes the power liftgate, something our old car didn't have either. Really like the way it drives. My only complaint would be the budget tires they use.

CX-5,Edmunds,"I have always owned Honda and Acura products, but with the shortage, and the economy, I decided to down size from my Acura MDX lease. If you notice with the shortage, lots are pretty empty.  I could have waited for the right Honda I wanted, but the Mazda's were in stock, hence the CX-5 and CX-9 rocket in sales the last two months.
 The interior of the Mazda is very nice.  All the materials feel top notch, except for the lower doors and the floor mats and carpet. Worst Floor Mats and carpet ever!  Cheap and hard to vacuum.  
The Infotainment screen is finally larger, but working it is annoying with the knob controller.  I have gotten used to it, but would not buy it again just for that.  Voice commands are not much better.
Little things like the heated steering wheel is only warm on the sides, not the top or bottom, and the button is on the console?  The power seat setting and memory is on the seat itself, and does not light up at night.  When you set your power seat, it does not set your mirrors as well, so after maintenance or car wash, I always have to adjust them, unlike my previous car which adjusted with the hit of the memory seat button
The rear headrest should be able to slide down and be flush with the back seat (Acura does) for better visibility
I got the regular 2.5 engine, as I am not a fan of Turbo's.  While it is decent enough, the transmission could be quicker.  Gas mileage is also disappointing for a 4cyl with a six speed auto.
Overall it is a very nice SUV, but with just a little stretch of that wheelbase and maybe better OEM tires, the ride could be just that much better.  I will be replacing the TOYO tires with Michelin when the time comes.

CX-5,Edmunds,"Things I love: 
- fun to drive 
- great handling 
- good gas mileage 
- should be very reliable 
- price was right 
- AWD handles well in rain, I suspect it will also do well in the snow 
- Carbon Edition paint makes it easy to find in a sea of CX-5s 
- the black seats with red stitching (looks magenta, in my opinion) is unique and really nice 
- the black rims are gorgeous 
- I get lots of compliments and questions about how much I like it 

Things I don’t love: it just isn’t as nice as I expected. At a glance, it’s very polished and riding around in it is plenty comfortable and seems luxurious. But, the fit/finish doesn’t impress me. The first time I cleaned it up, I noticed that anything immediately out of sight is not upholstered/finished. On that note, the carpet is hard to get clean, particularly removing dog hair (but perhaps that’s specific to my two beasts). The glossy surfaces scratch if you touch them with anything other than a fingertip and the other surfaces also seem easy to damage (four months of my six year old climbing across the back seat has scratched the rear console pretty badly; a Rubbermaid bin leaned against the dash for 20 minutes left an indentation that took a week+ to recover). The front fender popped out within the first few weeks of owning it, but I was able to pop the clip back in with some effort. 

Would I buy it again? With my budget, yes. I’m hoping it will be as reliable as three trusted mechanics (and Consumer Reports) told me it will be.

CX-5,Edmunds,"Started out at the dealer. Test drove the cx 5 GT signature and ended up getting it home and noticed pathetic performance as it didn't have the turbo and the seats were too hard. took it back to the dealer and upgraded to the reserve thinking it was the same as the car we test drove. Turn out it had the same seats as the other and the signature had upgraded seats. I loved the acceleration with the turbo and the windshield display but that's where it ended.  the seats were too hard and driving a short distance my back was on fire, when the fuel light came on you only had a few miles to find gas and not having a touch screen was not desirable. The biggest disappointment was the height of the rocker panel. It was too high off the ground and when you had to literally climb in and the floor pan was so deep it was like getting into a swimming pool. My wife had an artificial hip and it took her several minutes just to get in and out. Installing running boards didn't even help We drove it for about three months and couldn't take it no more. We realized why drive a car that you hate. We started checking out other cars thoroughly and decided on a Honda CR-V.

Interior color and black leather make for really dark,drab interior. Seats are not that comfortable. Sunroof small. Wind noise while driving with windows down very irritable, Gas mileable ok but not great (28mpg).Acceleration adequate with standard engine. Value for price adequate. Everyone loves steering, I find it uninspiring and steering wheel to thin. Whoever designed the interface for using all the car's features should be forced to use them everyday to get their pay and food; horribly laid out and frustrating. Pallette of exterior colors not very appealing. This is my 3rd Mazda and although time will tell on dependability I expect it to be good. Visabilty not up to the best in class. Vehicle looks are subjective but it's decent. Doing your own oil changes not the easiest I've seen. Truly this vehicle should have about a 3 day tutorial from Mazda on how to get the most from it. On the positive side it doesn't have the dreaded CVT tranny. Gets excellent safety ratings. Comes with a real temp.spare tire. AWD system again not the best but adequate for 90% of people.

Ok, have now owned for 10 months and put 15k on it. Dependability as expected excellent. Still finding it irritating and somewhat uncomfortable. Sunroof is useless without some sort of wind blocker which it does not have. Same for driving with windows down, going to have to get wind blockers for them too.

CX-5,Edmunds,"I purchased this vehicle mostly based on its safety features, but I’ve quickly grown to hate driving my 2021 CX-5. The main problem is the automatic transmission. Shifting in/out of low gear(s) is horrible, accompanied by lurching and thumping, when starting or stopping but especially when cornering. The shifting is too frequent and way too rough. Aside from that, the engine (Touring) is slightly under-powered, and the braking is substantially under-powered. So this CX-5 takes forever to catch up to traffic from a stop light, then you have to press the brake pedal too much to slow to a stop, while the rough transmission is jerking the vehicle around. Unfortunately the 2021 CX-5 is garbage and I’m sad that I’m stuck with this piece of junk until it’s paid off, but I’m so glad we hung onto our older (2016) CX-3 so I can just leave this horrible CX-5 in my garage until I can get a better replacement vehicle … I doubt I will ever consider buying another Mazda after owning this CX-5, despite being quite happy with our Mazda CX-3, CX-9 and MPV.

CX-5,Edmunds,"1-2 months ago I bought a CX5. A large part of my getting this SUV is because with my age and arthritis a car which is higher off the ground is easier to get in and out of than a sedan which is low to the ground. My decision was also based on my having read in Consumer Reports magazine that Mazda as a company was rated first place in their cars' reliability. Reviews in car magazines mentioned that the CX5's turbo-charger gives it a 0-60 mph time of about 6 seconds which pins me to the seat when I stomp on the accelerator in a highway entrance ramp. it also handles like it's glued to the road, which is in part a characteristic of the 4 wheel drive and the large tires. I have the top of the line ""signature"" model. It's heads up display is great and you can even alter the position of where on the lower windshield the display is projected - it can be moved vertically and horizontally. Another great option is that the accessory computer display is not a touch screen. My wife's car has a touch screen and I have to reach for it which takes my eyes off the road. The CX5's display is controlled by a 2.5 inch rotary knob which is just behind the gear-shift. That knob not only turns, but also tilts side to side, making selecting options easier than a touch screen. Right next to that knob is a small rotary knob which controls the radio's volume - pushing on it vertically turns the radio on or off. That display always shows the time. The doors lock automatically when the car reaches about 10 mph. There's two seat position memory buttons. The windshield wipers turn on automatically in the rain. The arm rest box has two USB-A outlets. The front seats can be heated or cooled. The steering wheel can be heated. The side rear view mirrors can be folded in and they also do so when you turn the car off. The center display can show you a 360 degree view, and automatically shows a front view when you're near something ahead like when I park in my home's garage it prevents me from running into the garbage pails. I'm not keen in the very large size of the key fob and its buttons are too small and are too easily pushed unintentionally, but it contains a conventional key inside of it, and you can easily replace the internal button battery. The headlights have an enormous lateral field of view.

CX-5,Edmunds,"I have the 2021 Grand Touring with the standard 2.5L.  White exterior with black leather.  This is our 4th CX-5 and is my favorite one so far.  The standard 2.5 has plenty of punch for me.  It is zippy around town and fun to drive with enough punch to get the job done on the highway.  I really like the cylinder cut-off feature.  With the display set to monitor the cylinder activation, it amazes me just how smoothly this car transitions from 4, to 2, to complete shut-off, and back to 4 cylinders.  It is seamless.  In my 2016 CX-5 the best I was able to get on the highway was about 32-33mpg.  In this 2021 with the cylinder cut-off I just completed two trips on the highway and achieved 39.6 mpg and 41.5 mpg.  This was a true measured calculation from fill-up to fill-up, with documented mileage.  The pump was always stopped at the auto cut-off on each fill-up.  I was extremely pleased with that performance.  This was achieved with the air conditioner turned off, windows up and cruise control set at no more then 5mph over the limit.  This engine really rewards you for smooth throttle input on the highway.  I could not be more pleased.

From our previous experience with the CX-5's, I know that the all wheel drive system is excellent on the road and I have always been pleased with the handling in light to moderate snowfalls here in PA.  The newer models have stepped things up in the safety department with many welcome features geared towards keeping you safer on the road.

I researched new vehicles online for a few months. Full disclosure- my list only included 0% financing offers. While I wanted to stay in an SUV, Mazda was running a special on the 6 at the time. Having never driven a car, I thought ""why not test drive it and see"". Side note- it was absolutely fabulous... but same problem, not a great fit for the hubby. We were on our way out when our salesman asked if we had looked at the CX-5. My first thought was ""nope, too much $, will not pay for financing""... but we took a look anyway and I sure did like what we saw. Now, we are not ""fancy"" people. I did not want leather/sunroof/bells/whistles/etc... just a solid, reliable, small SUV with enough cargo space for groceries and the occasional small furniture purchase. I was definitely interested in the newer safety features available, but thought they would not be an option without a high-level trim. I was wrong. One test drive in the CX-5 Touring and we were in love. Plenty of head/leg room, extraordinary amount of standard safety features, good gas mileage, luxurious interior, unique exterior styling, sturdy build, comfortable, and fun to drive... all at the right price point ($29k).

Forester,Edmunds,"I researched all the small and medium-size SUVs for a replacement for our 2016 Hyundai Tucson Eco and the Forester seemed the best choice. It broke our string of five no-problem Hyundais going back to 2000. The Forester delivers in all categories. It's roomy, economical and safe. The gas mileage is between 33-35 on the highway and 31-33 combined. It's about the same as the Tucson. A lot of magazines criticize the CVT transmission, but it's a welcome change from the dual-clutch in the Tucson which was really the only complaint. The Forester is more comfortable and has more cargo space. It's quiet on the highway and the full-time 4-wheel drive is fantastic in the rain. I love the car. Only complaint is that trying to figure out all the electronics is baffling. But, eventually, that will come around. One feature I don't like is that the engine shuts off when you stop in traffic for more than a few seconds. When you lift your foot off the brake, it sort of bangs back to life. There is a switch to override this function, but you have to turn it on every time you drive the car. There should be a permanent override or simply do away with this supposedly environmental function. We purchased the base model which had the wheel upgrade and interior rubber mat package.

Forester,Edmunds,"I'm a 6'2"" man with an unusually long torso. Most new vehicles come with standard moon roof, and no height control in the passenger seat. This means I do not fit in most new vehicles without special orders. Some of the only vehicles I fit comfortably in, with the trim levels I want, are the Forester (taller headroom) and Outback (standard option to delete moon roof). Luckily I love these cars.

I have a 2021 Forester Premium with the power lift gate package, which adds rear cross traffic alert. The safety is fantastic. Subaru's adaptive cruise control can follow start and stop traffic, or intelligently slow down if the car ahead slows. It can also automatically steer and change lanes, although the system requires a good amount of input. It cannot follow hard corners for instance. Android Auto means I can use my phone's Google Maps for navigation. The tech is quite good even on less-than-loaded models. Overall I think the Premium pack with power lift gate is open of the better options on the market.

It has buttons! I hate the Tesla style over reliance on touchscreens. They get dirty, and they're dangerous to use while driving. The Forester Premium has all the right controls (volume, climate) on physical buttons. Once you commit those controls to muscle memory it's a superior experience.

The engine rocks. Reviewers complain that the engine is smaller in class, while praising best in class fuel efficiency. The two are related. The Forester has similar EPA gas mileage to my old Civic (!), and feels if anything faster. It corners like a dream. My wife is not a performance driver and she is still commenting on the lack of body roll. The Forester comes standard with a CVT which maximizes fuel efficiency. Drivers used to harsh manual transmissions often feel CVTs are weaker because they don't jerk as much. Think of the Subaru boxer engine more like a luxury experience - the power delivery is immediately and smooth at all speeds. I spend 1/3 the amount on gas that my family spend for their Land Cruiser, yet this thing can probably race my old Civic, with similar gas mileage. It's insane.

It is also a Subaru in all the right ways. Tons of storage. I packed for 2 people for a week going cross country, and barely even used the back seat. We arrived at a muddy back road and engaged the X-Mode just for fun. The vehicle had zero issues and I arrived with more energy thanks to the excellent safety features and adaptive cruise control. Equally capable rock climbing as at highway speed.

Complaints? The ride is quite stiff. It feels fine on the highway, but over poorly maintained city streets where truckers have built up brake zone ruts it's like a roller coaster. The infotainment system could be faster and integrate more seamlessly with Android Auto. When I plug in my phone I want Google Maps - make it happen. The steering assist is a bit annoying. It requires such constant input that I don't feel I'm gaining much. However, up models (especially on the Outback) have even more advanced navigation that likely makes this better. The stop-start cruise control with engine cutoff for efficiency is still a winner, it's just not a Tesla autopilot. Storage could be better. The cup holders are far back to put the X-Mode button on display, and the console has fairly small bins, so you're often hunting for a spot to put things. It's not terrible, but you get the feeling if they relocated the X-Mode button you could gain the storage you need. Rear headroom is poor with the moon roof, so rear comfort is a bit of a budget experience compared to the front. Interior is worlds better than the last generation Subaru, but they still need a design expert to to get rid of those last vestiges of awful cheap plastic where your hands go (especially around the door handle, and around the shifter, for me personally).

Overall. Zero issues after a six-hour trip into mountains and dirt roads and mud. Dealership experience was ideal. Fuel consumption is beautiful.

Forester,Edmunds,"For me, an SUV needs to have plenty of well-arranged space, a quiet and smooth ride, safety features, reliability and decent gas mileage. The 2021 Forester checks all the boxes. The Subaru Eye Sight system has to be one of the industry leaders, and has been improved even since my 2019 Subaru. I suspect some might feel that the car is under-powered, but merging onto the interstate is no problem, the fuel economy is much better than with a V6, and thi is an SUV, not a sports car",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9920758008956909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Forester,Edmunds,"What a difference three years makes ! The 2021 Forester’s head and shoulders better than its’ predecessor. Proximity key makes for easy access. With key on your person, put your hand in the handle, and the car unlocks ( done from the passenger side, unlocks all doors !). Rear hatch opens seamlessly, faster than the previous model, also has heavier duty struts. Once the hatch is open, there is now a second button that closes and locks all the doors. Interior is rugged, especially the tailgate area being covered with rubber.  Eyesight’s better than ever, but, lane centering option is very jerky. Another nuisance is having to turn off the engine shutdown feature, otherwise at each stop and resuming driving sequence, the engine restart is noticeable, but not to the point it jerks you around.

Forester,Edmunds,"After years of Hondas and Toyotas and the poor treatment from the Toyota Dealership where I had purchased 7 Toyotas it was time to find different. During the pandemic I had lots of time to do online research and narrowed my choice to the Ford Bronco Sport or the Subaru Forester. The test drive and the style made the Forester my choice. We had two Toyotas to trade, A 2015 and a 2016 as it was time to go to one vehicle. The local Subaru dealer gave us $29,000 for the Toyotas and took $4,000 off the MSRP of the 2021 Forester Touring plus the 0% financing for 36 months made a great deal. The ride is great, the boxer engine is smoother than any V-8 we have owned also no torque steer when you accelerate.

Forester,Edmunds,"I’ve driven Mercedes-Benz sedans for most of the last 20 years and while my wife has owned SUVs most of the that time, I never really cared for them.  Lately I’ve had lower back problems and came to the simple realization that my wife’s car was much easier to get in and out of than my own.

I bought the base model 2021 Forester with the wheel package and while this is definitely no luxury car (not even close), it isn’t annoying or uncomfortable.  Everything about it is simply adequate.  It is smooth and quiet on the freeway, though wind noise intrudes above 80 MPH or on windy days.  It is adequately powerful, though not in any way fast.  It gets adequate fuel economy (30MPG at 80 MPH, though still breaking in and may improve).  It even handles adequately, with a safe and secure feeling, tight turning radius and only moderate body lean, though of course there is nothing sporty about the handling.

In short, this car is an appliance.  Like my washing machine or coffee maker, it goes about its business without any annoyances, and of course with it’s high seating position it is even easier to get in and out of than my wife’s Mercedes GLC300, let along the Mercedes E300 I traded for it.

Speaking of trade, my regular Mercedes dealer of the last 15 years also carries Subaru in the shop next door, so even with the pandemic and microchip shortage, they gave me the new car at a slight discount (everywhere else was marking up new AND used cars a few thousand dollars over sticker) and matched CARMAX’s very high trade-in value on my E300.  In the end, I ended up with an even trade for my 80,000 mile old 2018 E300 for a brand new Forester and just paid the tax.

Its no luxury car, but so far (1000 miles in one weekend) it is a smooth, comfortable and solid-feeling car that I expect to give me years of trouble-free driving.",0.0,0.741147518157959,0.0,0.0,0.11901700496673584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6163805723190308,0.0,0.0,0.8259809017181396,0.5588780641555786,0.0,0.0

Take a look on youtube as to how to clean.  Hole by hole with a dental tool.  Subaru has a head up or head straight ahead system which is actually kinda cool BUT if they were so concerned about keeping your eyes on the road then why not a heads up display on the inside windshield?

Forester,Edmunds,"I got my Forester sport in June 2021. First impression was great. After using the car for a week I started noticing many quality issues:
1- Engine noise is not good
2- interior noise such as plastic cracking and stuff moving that you can't find
3- Mpg is never honest after driving for 4 months I only got 22MPG combined not even closed to what it was advertised for.
4- Some mechanical noise stuff moving outside the car under the engine when you drive on a rough dirt road.
5- Not comfortable driver seat. If drive for a long distance you will for sure get back pain from setting into that uncomfortable driver seat or the passenger seat.
6- Eyesight system is never good when you enter a tunnel or driving in the city. It immediately stop and you almost lose control of the vehicle. Almost got me in a deadly accident + Adaptive Cruse control will not detect car who just pulled in front of you and you will need to stay alert all the time.
7- Engine power is like dragging a dead body. All sound but no power 
8- Towing capacity is just 1500lb and you need to pay around 1k to install a good hitch that looks like a factory install and for what to add a bike rack!
9- Wind noise makes you feel that you are riding a bicycle
10- Sound system quality is bad 
11- water leaks inside the door panel after car watch which could damage your speakers.

Overall I wish I did some research and no got fooled by the look of the car.

Forester,Edmunds,"Purchased a brand new 2021 mid-level Forester and so far, have regretted the decision.  This car is clearly aimed at folks my age (mid 50's) who more than anything are considered ""immigrants to technology"" but now are driving a vehicle loaded with tech that borders more of an autonomous experience.  
I can't tell you how many times my poor dog has been nearly launched through the front windshield as the ""eyesight"" feature detects a car slowing/stopped in front of me and slams on the brakes.  So far, this has not happened on an icy road but when it does, we will end up either in the rear-end of the car in front of us or sliding into oncoming traffic.
During highway travel, the car takes over, (especially with the cruise control feature activated) slowing us down and correcting if I get too close to the fog lines.  
And God forbid you don't want to wear you seat belt or take it off too early, you're treated to the ascending warning chime which makes you want to poke out your eyeballs hoping it will stop. 
Too much happening on the dash as far as lights activating telling you something, taking your eyes off of the road.  
The tiny graphics imprinted on the steering wheel buttons are not good for those who we
glasses and have to look down at them for several seconds to see exactly which button they just pressed.  
Having recurring issues with the bluetooth system dropping calls.
If I can speak for those in my generation, this is just too much tech and too frustrating of a driving experience.

Forester,Edmunds,"Edmunds review is right on the mark. I had to sell due to the noise, power, and tech deficiencies at  3150 miles. Purchased a 2022 Hyundai  Santa Cruz :)
My 1st Subaru and I really thought I liked the 21 Forester Sport . The LED head/fog lights and  AWD are 5 stars ,Got a great deal on the Sport w/ power lift gate, premium sound and  0% financing.  I kayak and cycle , so there's lots of space for my gear inside.  I should have rented it 1st before purchasing. The BAD: The start/stop is random/annoying, MPG avg is 22, ride is stiff/bumpy but ok, engine/power/trans are ok, the premium stereo covers the noise, the 3 screens were cool at 1st but they are a distraction. Starlink, Eyesight seems to work ok. The tech stuff is just not put together well, too many buttons, distractions, and sometimes buggy. The manuals are a bit huge. The roof rack is a problem, the factory  rails/crossbars work with my kayaks but not my bikes. I purchased a Thule and Yakima roof rack for my bikes and they caused too much wind noise. So I had to return those. I found a Malone brand Roof Rack that attached to the roof rails and it hold my bikes with less wind noise. I have to remove the rack when I want to transport my kayaks. Washing is a chore because  mud and dirt get in between all 5 doors/seals/frame and it makes it harder to clean.  I think Subaru needs to refine the Forester design and improve the drivers experience. Overall it's  an OK vehicle. I guess I don't love the quirks of my ""Foz"". My pet's don't drive and it's not an option to turn it in to a dog house.

So far our ""Suba"" has not let us down, able to carry anything we have asked it to, including 5 cat cages!

Love the LED headlights, you will never want to go back to halogen after this!

RAV4,Edmunds,"We recently purchased a 2021 RAV4 XLE PREMIUM trim for my husband. This SUV is amazing and comfortable, as he is 5’11 and I am 5’9”. The 2.5L engine has a lot of pick me up when needed, which I don’t understand how some are saying this vehicle is underpowered, sure it’s no 8cylinder but it has more than sufficient power for everyday use. It’s very roomy, much more than my new 2021 NX 300 makes me like the RAV4 a little more since it’s also very reasonable in price with all the features it brings. We bought ours with just the features the XLE Premium has to offer with no extra add ons, since this is a commuter vehicle and my husband drives 92 miles a day round trip and a full tank of gas lasts a little over 4 days. That’s amazing for it being a gasoline engine and not a hybrid, which we tend to stay away from for now until that technology is a little more perfected. Overall I definitely recommend this trim level RAV4, oh and it’s assembled in Canada which I know from experience produces amazing quality Toyota models. Test drive one for yourself! We traded in our reliable 2017 Camry SE for this one and don’t regret it one bit! We are a Toyota family for life!!!! 

Update as of 10/05/2021 - We are still in love with our RAV4 and it’s been very reliable after 12,000 miles.

RAV4,Edmunds,"I'm 62 years old and this was to be my retirement vehicle. I used to be a toyota loyalist. Although I have been driving a buick for 10 years. Had a 2003 Rav4. Drove it for 8 years until totaled in accident. I guess I'm too old now.  Decided to be economical and buy the New Rav4. Wrong. Way too much noise. Road and wind noise.  Engine noise is awful. Steering bad. Never had issues with cloth seats before. This model is terrible.  Soils so easily. Just touch it with anything. Then when I try to clean it.  It makes water rings. The seats are hard and thin and uncomfortable.  My husband complained about lighting. He's correct. Awful. Very little wimpy interior lights.  WHY ?  And back to seats. No height adjustment for passenger seat! Really they couldn't put the little hand crank to raise or lower.  The sun visors are too small and without raising the seat everytime you are blinded. Everything is hard plastic touches. No comfort.  To use the buttons on lower left you have to twist and lower your head. Not good. Back doors do not open far enough. Other small suvs open all the way out. The touch screen is horrible to look at. Faded and harsh. Looks like terrible TV picture.  The radio speakers not good. Cheap sounding. Not clear. Toyota has the levels and packages crazy on this. To get the better features it is way pricey. You can go ahead and get a midsize suv. Which is exactly what I did. But couldn't get Toyota sadly. Way too pricey. Sadly had to get another foreign maker.  Midsize with luxury features. But all the sharp sporty looks. The new 2021 Kia Sorento. LOVE!

RAV4,Edmunds,"I have had this RAV4 for a year now.  It is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  This RAV4 replaced a 2010 CRV EXL that I had for over 10 years.  It was a great, reliable vehicle, but this RAV4 way out performs the CRV.  But then this is newer technology also.  The RAV4 has more power, smoother ride with the 2.5L 4 cyl with the 8 speed auto trans (a great combination).  I get great gas mileage, between 33 and 34 mpg on the highway, and between 28 to 29 around town.  I love the AWD and the 19"" wheels.  Being this is my first new vehicle in over 10 years, I love all the new technology and safety features that my old vehicle did not have.  You can get a laundry list of all the great features it has on the Toyota site, so no need to list them all here.  I realize that many new vehicles have similar new technology and safety features, but I really like the styling of the RAV4 and Toyota's reputation of quality and reliability.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this vehicle.  Being in the Detroit area, I am criticized for not buying one the 'Big 3' vehicles, but I don't work for them, and their quality and reliability can't compare to Toyota as far as I am concerned.  I will put far less money into maintenance with the Toyota and it will last far longer.

I have not experienced any steering or road noise issues mentioned in other reviews. I do agree the lumbar support could be improved (but I could say the same for the competition).

The road noise is bad. Like really bad. It is as if somebody has a hair dryer on in the back.

The road noise cannot be even mitigated with music because the speakers are of very poor quality. The music is not crisp at all. I have never heard such low quality sound in a car. Its comparable to listening on the speaker of your phone.

Speaking of phones and music. That is the only way to get music into the car. There is no CD player. There is no auxiliary audio in. You have to do everything through your phone. This is not the terrible but it is super annoying and limiting. Just another cheap out from Toyota.

In terms of driving it does not handle well. I likely should have gone for the XSE which has higher end suspension in it. The XLE sways around corners and generally feels like it needs new shocks. 

The view is not great either. They compensate for it by having a ton on sensors but it would just be better if the layout was designed properly.

RAV4,Edmunds,"I have always owned and favored Toyota’s and Honda’s. Recently my family has had many issues with their newer model Honda’s and now Toyota seems to be lacking as well. At 3,423 miles my transmission went out in my new 2021 Rav 4. While stranded in dangerous Atlanta traffic I realized that I can no longer trust Toyota. They don’t make them like they used too! Being a mechanic for 25 plus years I would recommend staying with Japanese car manufacturers for daily drivers, but not Toyota or Honda. Do yourself a favor and buy a Mazda or Subaru. After my warranty covered the cost to replace my transmission I traded the Rav 4 in for a Subaru Crosstrek sport and I love it. It will live much longer and has great AWD capabilities. My brother has also had 10 plus years of hassle free satisfaction out of his Mazda’s.

RAV4,Edmunds,"Hired the Hybrid and was looking forward to it.

Economy was 6 litres/100Km on mostly country driving.  Not good as my 2.0 litre 2005 BMW gets the same and does not need a battery that will need replacing at a sizeable cost.

Dynamics were ok for an entry level car.  The ABS did not do very well when stopping on dirt roads.  The traction control was worse.  If you accelerated too hard, the back swung out to the side.  Possibly it is an early (and cheaper) generation traction control unit.  Latest generation traction control and ABS measure wheel slip many times a second and hence the wheel does not noticeably slip as it slipping is stopped just as it starts.  The Toyota seemed to have a less sophisticated control unit as the wheels spun, stopped spinning, spun again, stopped spinning and spun again, which is why the rear end slid out sideways.  May work better on smooth bitumen?

Comfort was good in the front seats.  I can see people taking a test drive and being impressed.  The road noise while on a highway in the back was quite high as there is little sound insulation for the rear passengers  and the boot has places with no sound insulation at all.  To speak to the rear passengers needed us in the front to raise our voices so much that it was better to speak when in towns with slower road speed. The windows did not stop the sun burning through onto your arm. More advanced cars use different glass that looks the same but stops most of the heat getting through so passengers are more comfortable, the aircon does not need to work as hard, etc.

Safety.  The self steering was ok so long as there were well painted lines on both sides of the road such as a major multi lane highway.  On good country roads, it would it was unable to detect the left side white line unless it was new and well painted.  Roads where the left edge was less defined such as parts missing or a section was damaged where a truck ran wide in the past etc., meant the car would continue to slowly veer off the road.  So.  Ok for good highways, not for driving on the usual country roads.  Passing other cars was a bit slow.  I know that electric motors can provide enormous power short short times such as say 10 seconds (I am engineer).  Not sure why Toyota did not let the battery give the motor more power so overtaking would be safer?

Sophistication was low.  The touch panel was not intuitive to use.  If you walk up to the car and unlock it with the key fob, the windows will not wind down so you can let the car cool down before driving off.  You have to put the key fob in the centre console and push the start button.  This means there are no smarts in the electricals, it's just a wire to the switch and battery.  By comparison, in a 16 year old 3 series BMW, you can use the key fob to unlock and wind down the windows as you walk up.  No need to get in a hot car.  This is because the windows, etc., are all smart and under the control of the car's computer which does what you want when you press the fob buttons, such as just open the drivers door, or open all doors, or wind up all windows and close the sunroof as you hold the ""lock car"" button.

Overall a basic unsophisticated car.  Quite good and a cheap price (around $48K), hence maybe you cannot expect the latest (or expect a 2005 level of sophistication) such as high quality ABS and traction control, a quiet ride in the back and creature comforts.",0.0,0.0,0.5563037395477295,0.4089275598526001,0.38329076766967773,0.11110079288482666,0.0,0.20908820629119873,0.0,0.6066344976425171,0.4716684818267822,0.9277465343475342,0.0,0.02108776569366455,0.11473214626312256,0.2932863235473633,0.9529396295547485

RAV4,Edmunds,"We rented one of these for two weeks when a vehicle was in the shop. We got the AWD because we live in Alaska and this is an AWD SUV, right? We’ve owned Toyotas for years and figured no issues.
Wrong.
We got about 10” of snow one night and this vehicle could not get out of the driveway. It got stuck in the snow in the driveway.
Several issues:
1. AWD is decent for driving down the road in some inclement weather. it is bad when stuck. 4WD would sent power to all 4 wheels. AWD varies the power by what the computer wants to do, not where I want the power to go. This is why it’s good to avoid AWD if you are going to need power to all 4 wheels irrespective of what the computer says.
2. The ground clearance on this is horrible for a vehicle that claims to be an SUV. I can understand if this were a commuter vehicle like a Camry or Maxima or Impala. But this just does not work.
3. The vehicle has NO tow bolts. So we are trying to find a place to attach the tow rope and there is no place to attach it. We wound up using part of the upper engine frame because we had nowhere else to attach the tow rope. And even then, the vehicle could not overcome the amount of snow.,

Takeaway: if you live in Arizona or Texas or Florida where you never get snow, this would likely work. Bit of rain, even torrential rain, and AWD will do you fine for the roads. But if you live in Alaska or Montana or Idaho or Maine where you can get snow, and I mean real snow, not just a dusting here and there, do yourself a favor. Just get a real 4WD SUV with some ground clearance, tow hooks in the front and back, and some decent tires.

RAV4,Edmunds,"I purchased my 2021 Toyota Rav4 new in August. The panels between the front and rear windows on both sides of my car are discolored and look like the plastic is melting. Magee Toyota in Hanover, MA replaced one side in January. Within a month both side panels discolored again right where the brackets are. I contacted Toyota and requested a meeting with a Toyota Service Department supervisor. They had a representative contact me, and I was told that the problem is Solar related and they will not help with the problem. I have a bumper to bumper warranty and the windows are between the bumpers, but they will do nothing.",0.9681005477905273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
RAV4,Edmunds,"First, the fuel economy is great. Although it only has 205 HP, with the turbo it does just fine on acceleration. Break system is very good as well has stable during hard breaking.. Road noise ? Very quite. The motors does get heard when mashing the gas, but what do you expect. Got the LE AWD with cloth seat, didn't want leather. The reason I went with the Toyota is the 100,000 mile warranty is transferable, when non of the other would transfer. When you pay $30K for a vehicle, put 7K miles on it, then get a offer from the dealer of $5K more than I paid for it, seems I did good on this one.",0.9351053237915039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9889521598815918,0.0,0.0,0.0
