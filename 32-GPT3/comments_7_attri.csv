CR-V,Edmunds,"When my BMW X3 lease was up, I needed the affordability of the CR-V.  I went with the EX-L so I could enjoy some of the same amenities I was accustomed to in my X3. I love the leather seats and warmers.  The sunroof is a plus.  I’m very impressed with the size. The CR-V has much more legroom in the back seat. It’s easy for little ones to climb into. The rear cargo area fit all of our luggage for a family of 4 road trip. Eventually we may need something bigger, but this is suitable for now.  I love the gas mileage and efficiency. The adaptive cruise and lane keep assist are new to me, and I love these features on a long road trip. The infotainment system has given me no trouble and Apple Car Play is great to have. I love the extra USB ports. They definitely come in handy for charging multiple devices. 

I’ve driven literally every car in this class, and the CR-V has been my favorite by far. Though it can’t compete with the performance and experience of the X3, it has some punch - more than expected. Overall this is a great car for getting the job done safely and affordably!",1,0,1,0,0,1,1

RAV4,KBB,"Very hard to buy one I wanted a new one and dealers would not sell to out of state buyers.  I bought one new from Carvana had to drive to Raleigh NC to get it.  I was determined to buy this car.  I had a charge station installed so it was ready when I got the car (the charge product was a ""Juice Box 32"" which charges the car just fine.  With charge station it will go from 0% to 100% in about 4+hours.  If you just drive locally the meter says it will go 45 miles on a single charge.  I wanted the XSE but had to settle for an SE.  I plug it in at night and it ready to go the next day.  If you can find one buy it I paid about $5K over MSRP used I am a very happy person.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0,0,0,1,0,-1,0

RAV4,Edmunds,"I've always driven General Motors vehicles but in March 2021, I decided to give Toyota a chance after hearing wonderful things about the Rav4.  After having the car for less than one month, I was at a stop light - completely stopped - and my car lunged forward TWICE and hit the car in front of me.  While at the body shop, the technician was pulling the car around and had his foot on the brake and said the RMPs went up and the car lunged again.  I immediately reported it to Toyota after the first incident.  They sent someone to the body shop to perform diagnostic tests.  The test was completed on 4/14.  I reported the second incident on 4/27 (immediately after it was reported to me) and was told they could not do anything until the Toyota engineers review the diagnostic test data.  To sum it up, I have a brand new car that I have not driven since 4/1/21 because I do  not feel it is safe to drive.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

CX-5,KBB,"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this.

All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first.",0,-1,0,0,0,0,0

Equinox,Edmunds,I rented a 2021 Equinox for a week.  Was pleasantly surprized it did everything well. The 4 cyl engine had me fooled it was a V6 until I opened the hood - its got V6 levels of quietness & smoothness.  The ride was as smooth & quiet as a Malibu or Camry - much smoother & quieter than several Toyota Rav4's I have rented.  The transmission was silky smooth (unlike the jerky Rav4). The vehicle tracked straight on the highway.  The AC was cold.

~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.

Rogue,KBB,"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver’s side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver’s side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the “infotainment system” has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the “camera” button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an “off” type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70’s where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe.",0,0,-1,0,0,0,0

CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my Signature now for about 6 months and have put 10k miles on it (runs between NC and MA).

First, a shoutout to Edmunds Mazda leasing information person who responded quickly to my request.  Got it just before going into the dealership and shamed them into rolling back the 3x lease rate they wanted initially.  Great info, and wonderful responsiveness!

I had resisted going the SUV route for a long time, but the sporting drivability of this vehicle has won me over.  I love to power into corners and feel the rear-wheel steering adjustment improve the tracking is wonderful.  And yes, the suspension is stiffer than some people like, but it also improves the driving experience for me.  Take a spirited test drive if you're not sure.

Coming from an Infiniti Q50, I still miss rear-wheel drive acceleration on occasion, but it looks like the CX-5 (CX-50) will have that when my lease is up so I can live with this quibble for now.  And although the CX-5 doesn't have all the luxury bells of the Infiniti, I still love getting 90% of it at 65% of the price!

Another ding is space, for people and for storage.  I have not had any complaints about people feeling like there's not enough room for them, so not a problem for me.  I will admit to occasionally wishing for a few more inches of storage space though.  I can work through it by reclining the front passenger seat though, so no showstoppers yet on the storage side.

Fit and finish are very well done.  I wasn't sure initially about the Caturra leather being the only seating option (brown?), but it's such a rich color I love it.  Ergonomically, I would wish for more aggressively bolstered seats, but my friends all think the seats function great from their perspectives.

The non-touch screen required only a short acclimation period; the controls in the center console are easy to find by touch and then get to navigation, entertainment, or communications.  I'll grouse about my inability to use voice controls effectively, but it's most likely me.

Sportage,Edmunds,"In general I'm a huge proponent of Korean manufacturers and all the strides they've made over the last 10 years or so. There's clear evidence of major improvements across various platforms, and investment into design and development across the entire Genesis / Hyundai / Kia lineup. 
I'll start with the good. The Sportage is a very unique looking car and is certainly not for everyone. But for those that appreciate its uniqueness, it's a wonder to look at and drive. Kia openly advertises the fact that its latest design includes components inspired by the Porsche Macan. My test drive experience of the fully loaded SX model resulted in an overall pleasant experience. I was amazed with the quality of interior, excellent heated & ventilated seats, the glass roof with a huge opening moon roof panel, the sound system, the intuitive entertainment and navigation, and the power train - the 2.0L performed wonderfully and never left me wanting more throughout its range on local streets and the highway. Nice Michelin tires were originally included with the car. One negative stood out right away - the road noise. But I was willing to live with it given all the positives. I bought the car and overall, with the exception of road noise and few corks around I still enjoy the drive a year and a half later. My FWD SX Turbo model gets me 26MPG average in an approximate 70/30 highway/local split, which isn't the greatest in its class but is respectable given the power and the cargo room it offers. The Sportage is one of those cars that's much bigger on the inside than out. It's very roomy. Most passengers can't believe how roomy and well appointed the interior is after seeing the exterior. Now on to the cons....
The Kia Sportage is the longest running model within Kia's lineup, so buying the 2021 top of the line SX trim I expected it to be completely refined with any potential issues ironed out. That was not the case, not even close. Instead, I've been having issues and non-stop dealer visits since day one. Out of the gate, day 1, the alignment was off and the car pulled to the left constantly while driving - unacceptable from a brand new vehicle and has never happened to me before (I purchased 18 brand new vehicles so far in my life). The infotainment head unit stopped working with Navigation just hanging endlessly if you try to put in an address. The head unit had to be replaced within 2 months of driving since new. There were few other body panel and door latch issues. The driver's door had to be slammed to actually latch closed. The weirdest issue by far, and the one that still haunts the car every few months and requires a dealer visit for some patch work, is the loud whistle at 50MPH coming from the left fender where the bumper seem meets the left fender. Issue occurred day one, and was in fact a LOUD whistle, I'm not exaggerating, that can be heard through music in side the vehicle and results in the most annoying drive experience you can imagine. After several dealer visits and them eventually involving Kia corporate engineers, the fix was put in place - some foaming insulation poured into the seem to fill in the gap and stop the whistle. It worked for few months until AZ heat caused the glue to separate and the panel to completely come off. The whole bumper had to then be replaced by the dealer (another week in the shop). Once replaced, the issue came back with vengeance! The seem had to be jammed open and more insulation foam went in. It's holding for now. The vehicle is about a year and a half old and it's been in the shop at least a month so far. I wish Kia included the memory driver's seat feature, at least in top trim models. We have 3 drivers in the household and constant manual adjustments are needed. I've had much cheaper vehicles that include the feature. The road noise gets worse with tire wear. I notice it more and more and it is noticed by most passengers that have experienced the competition, something like a CR-V, the CX-5 or the RAV4. Having had multiple Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia vehicles, I can say with fair certainty that the undercarriage insulation is only done correctly in their Genesis lineup. Kia and Hyundai are insulated in a minimalist fashion to save on weight and costs. My G80 was whisper quiet on the road. But then again, it cost twice as much as the Sportage. One more and final big gripe is the dealer experience. The facility, the staff, the very obvious lack of training in all areas are seriously getting to me. I dread each visit these days, even for regular maintenance. I often find myself having to tell the service specialist what to do to fix a given issue. In summary, I feel like the Sportage, being one of the oldest models in the company's lineup, could have used a little more quality control and attention to detail in its manufacturing process. This could have been a great seller and competitor, but instead falls short in areas that are actually fairly simple to address.",0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0

CX-5,Edmunds,"Owning a Honda Pilot for 9 years, I knew it was too big and thirsty for my current needs. But I was concerned about feeling cramped in a compact CUV. No worries there. The CX-5 was extremely comfortable, well-appointed, and packed with features for the price. I test drove a Carbon Turbo and a Touring preferred pkg at my first dealership. I had seen reviews say the base engine was a bit weak, but I found the regular engine to have plenty of pep and power. In fact, because of traffic, I didn't get to really open the turbo up during the test drive. I realized with my driving patterns, I really wouldn't have much need for the Turbo. 

The Carbon Edition is basically the Touring trim with the SV Preferred package items and some trim items unique to this level. Including a paint color called Polymetal Grey, which is actually a very sharp steely blue. It also has a different grill, black wheels, black trim around the wheel wells. On the interior, the black leather seats are accented with red stitching. A red interior is also available, which I though would look horrid, but actually looks pretty sweet in person.

As good as the car looks, it's also fun to drive. Very responsive and handles well. Loaded with safety and convenience features that make driving a pleasure. 

As I said in the title, I drove the CX-5 first, but wanted to see what else was out there. Anything else I drove just left me flat. Wasn't even close. So the CX-5 it was. Buy this car, and you'll be looking for reasons to go for a drive.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Forester,KBB,"I purchased November 2019, oyster (off-white) pearlcoat w/black interior, as a dealer demo model. It has all of the bells & whistles available. The dealer said it was in a ""minor"" accident before I got it, and the dealer discounted it about $9K to move it. The accident reportedly caused both rear quarter panels to be replaced, also had to replace the gate, seems pretty significant to me. 

The engine feels about right, it has a lot of features that are really nice. It's strong, the CVT is smooth. Towing capacity is only 1500 lbs. so it would have to be a very light trailer; I did add a hitch receiver for a bicycle rack. I added aftermarket load crossbars for my kayak, the Subaru-brand ones were ridiculously overpriced.

On the highway, it feels solid, stable, with little body lean in turns, tracks well, fairly quiet for this class. The cruise control and driver monitoring are great. Visual warnings for passing vehicles, active lane control, cruise control keeps you at your selected distance from the car ahead quite well. 70mph cruise nets about 34mpg, not bad. Gentle driving in town nets about 28mpg.

Infrequently, but remarkable nonetheless: in traffic, lane changes causes the cruise control to make the engine to roar up to 4000 rpm & seems to be closing on the car ahead too fast, then hard braking and order restored, but it's unsettling. Mostly, it's benign.

The auto-engine off feature needs work on the algorithm. It comes on about 30% of stops. By contrast, my wife has a same-year CRV stops the engine 90% or the time.

I don't notice any changes driving when I loaded it down with sand & rocks, except coming over a bump felt different.

Infotainment system works well, but it's best to get things set while parked, because it's not easy, trying to change while driving. Subaru should have a class about how to use the vehicle. The owner's manual etc. is a brick, and there's four different manuals incl. the main one and the ""quick start"" version.",0,0,0,-1,0,0,0

CX-5,Edmunds,"At 55, after buying Fords, a Maserati, and two Nissans and having driven Hondas, Toyotas and several sports cars and SUVs, I purchased my first Mazda based on commercial site reviews.  Looking for safety, reliability, and a great price with a loaded car.  Wanted to down size.  Thought I had found it in the CX-5. My test drive was short. My fault. Because I realized after driving the CX-5 the first day I bought it that that the front seats are beyond terrible. If you are over about 50 or have shoulder or back problems, avoid this car. The seats will make you suffer. We just got back from a 5 hour both ways vacation drive with less than 150 miles on the car starting out and by the time we got back we want to sell it even for a loss. Our backs and shoulders ached the whole time. The seats are so stiff, have no leg room support, and are so ergonomically painful, that no engineer who designed the seats could have driven any time in them or is a moron. We have since researched seat issues with this car and unfortunately  now know that this is a huge issue with this car. Hard to believe that a car company could design a beautiful, highly equipped, reliable and safe car that is ruined by its horrible car seats.

Rogue,Edmunds,Well I haven’t purchased the rogue yet but I do test drive it ! My husband and I test drove a Kia Sorento it was nice . We are trying to really take time and make sure we get one that’s right for the family he has a new Chevy truck! So we decided to test a few out that rated well ! So we had to drive to Jamestown NY. Since there’s no Nissan dealer near us in Pennsylvania! There’s one in Hornel NY. But we decided to go to Jamestown those two were the closest. Well we loved the Rogue everything about it ! The looks and the feel . Room is spacious! I’m surprised the one guy wrote he was 6 ft 1 talk and 240 lbs and was cramped because I’ve watched you tube videos on it and the one guy was 6 ft 1 or 2 and he said he was around 240 or 250 those were his words in the video he fit just fine with plenty of room he did adjust the steering wheel so it came out more ! But I know some people say it’s not speedy but I found it fun to me and my husband it’s beautiful that’s for sure and very solid ! I already have everything picked out for it once we test drive a few more ! To see  Honda we haven’t yet or Toyota  and Hyundai ! That will be it !! But I did look them all up and the Nissan looks so much better but my husband said I just can’t go by looks well I said you can by comfort cuz I honestly don’t know how the others are going to beat the rogue on that !!!

CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features

Tucson,KBB,"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money.",0,0,0,-1,0,0,0

RAV4,Edmunds,"I have owned so many cars in my lifetime but never a Toyota. I have bought used cars, cars that were just junk and I have bought new cars and most of them have let me down and failed prematurely. My background in the Military required an immense ability for attention to detail and trust me when I say that when something wasn't right with my vehicle, I knew it. Everything from the steering, to braking, to subtle noises and even distinctive smells that should not be coming from under my engine compartment that certainly hinted at trouble to come.
That being said, I can honestly say that I was thoroughly impressed with the workmanship and quality that was noticeable immediately when inspecting the exterior and interior of my new Rav4. You can feel it when you are driving in the response of the vehicle the way it handles, the way the steering feels in your hands and the purr of the motor you feel under your feet. You just get the sense that this car is going to last and is a worthy investment of safety and peace of mind.

CX-5,KBB,"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.

Rogue,KBB,"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Its a bit early to rate reliability and value.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
CX-5,KBB,"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
RAV4,KBB,"We bought this beautiful 2021 Hybrid Limited Rav4. The next day... it didn't start! Called Roadside assistance, they jumped it, we took it to the dealership, they didn't find a problem. Two days later, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance, they jumped the car. Next day, the car didn't start, called roadside assistance and got it towed to the dealership. Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them. They need to check the customers who have called for roadside assistance in the last few months and see the evidence there too and take action and do right by their customers versus waiting for them to take action first.",0,-1,0,0,0,0,0

CX-5,Edmunds,"I've had my 2021 Signature CX-5 for 2 months now and am thrilled with my purchase. Having owned a 2009 Mazda6 in the past, I expected excellent handling and this vehicle delivers. The steering is quick and accurate with the suspension providing a firm and controlled, but not harsh, ride which I find comfortable and reassuring. The turbo is definitely a good addition to the standard engine. While not a race car, the acceleration is linear with minimal turbo-lag and more than enough from either a standing start or for passing on the freeway.

The interior is very driver friendly and near-luxury. The driver's seat is comfortable and easily adjustable. The cabin is quiet enough for conversation at normal volume even at highway speeds. The 10 inch screen is well placed so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to view. I am not a fan of using a touch screen while driving so I appreciate the control wheel and push button controls which are easy and intuitive to use. I thought having Apple CarPlay/Android Auto was a ""must-have"" for my new vehicle, however I've found that I rarely use the feature since I actually prefer navigating with the Mazda system over Google Maps and usually listen to subscription satellite radio. Nevertheless, it works well when I do connect my phone.

I also appreciate using buttons and knobs for the climate control system rather than having to navigate through screen menus. Again, a thoughtful design to make it easier to use while driving.

CR-V,KBB,"We bought a 2017 CRV touring about 2 weeks ago. Took a trip to Jacksonville Florida from Maryland last week. Round trip was about 1500 highway miles. Its winter so no AC was used.  We have 2200 miles on it right now and we are getting 26.1 mpg and its going down. Its suppose to get 29 combined. 26 is not bad but when your expecting 29 its not good. We traded a 2016 CRV in and that was getting 24, it was suppose to get 27.
   We love everything else about it. The redesign inside and out is so much better than the 2016. It looks like a real SUV now. The leather seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of room in the backseat. There are a lot of nice safety features
   But if your looking for the 29mpg i dont think you will get it.",0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0

Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.

Sportage,KBB,"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Actually the only thing I miss is the searchable owners manual that can be bought up on the screen.  I like the size, storage and kick to open tailgate.  The seats are comfortable and sidelines are not obstructed.  Very pleased with the vehicle. One exception.  The electric shifter is hard to get used to and probably dangerous.  To shift into reverse the shifter has to be gripped while depressing a button on the side. Easy.  Then to move in reverse the shifter to be moved forward.  If you operate it like any other  car in the world and move it backwards,  add some gas a d the vehicle will move forward.  Very hard to get used to.  Otherwise love the vehicle.

To drive the car, one should feel nothing between the shifting of brake to gas pedal. The dealerships say it's a normal feel because of the auto engine idle.

We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have to chuckle when I see the likes of a Hyundai Santa Cruz or Ford Maverick because they are simply 2-row SUVs without a rear cargo cover.  So unless you need to carry something tall, then the smart choice is a compact SUV, of which the CR-V seems like the best choice.",0,1,0,1,0,1,1

Equinox,KBB,"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sportage,KBB,"Door handles on exterior are made with the cheapest thin plastic. Cargo area has very thin plastic that if a can of paint rolls it will crack the cheap thin plastic. 
Never should have wasted my money on the exterior protection which is absolutely ridiculous with exclusions.  I do not advise anyone to purchase this exterior protection.

Forester,Edmunds,"I've been driving since 1971 and this is my first SUV vehicle and the 2021 Subaru Forester in premium trim has that honor.  Delivered in October 2021 amid the chip shortage, we lucked out because the person above us on the wait list declined when the vehicle arrived and with our choice of Jasper Green and Premium trim being the one that arrived, how could we refuse.  So far our ""Suba"" has not let us down, able to carry anything we have asked it to, including 5 cat cages!  The engine to us has given good response and decent mileage, considering our home area is traffic congested Honolulu.  So I can only imagine when folks on the ""mainland"" drive from state to state, maybe thats when people will appreciate more power, but to me the 2.5 engine is just fine.  Love the LED headlights, you will never want to go back to halogen after this!  Love the moonroof, AC vents for the rear passengers and having the rear seats recline is a bonus and the safety systems are top notch, especially the blind spot monitoring and rear traffic alert which added a power lift gate.

Forester,Edmunds,"After 30 plus years driving Toyota vehicles I am a picky hard sell to change.  My dealership would not deal with me so I changed to Subaru with hopes of similar reliability.  My 2021 Forester limited has more options than a RAV4 limited and for over 3k less.  Standard AWD, comfortable ride and better mpg.  Just did a 300 mile weekend trip and the vehicle was great!  So far very happy with my first Subaru.
9/25/21 - not one issue with the new Forester.  Still rides quietly and solid with 3k miles.  I find the agile handling is confident and quick.  I like the eyesight auto cruise driving system to be very helpful for long drives.  In mostly city driving I’m averaging 24 mpg.  Great vehicle.

The cargo space is great and Hyundai is very generous with its included accessories. The worst thing about the car is the mpg and lack of acceleration.

Sportage,KBB,"Test drove the , CR-V, CX-9, VW Alltrack & Touareg , Tucson, Outback, Rouge, Escape & Rav4. The KIA Sportage SX was the best combination of quality, power and handling. This vehicle is just so fun to drive!
Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode. My highway numbers since then are still around 26-27 mpg on shorter trips.

Within a week, we called roadside assistance 3 times. Needless to say, it is a beautiful car, but something is draining the battery. It is NOT a reliable car, please don't be fooled and lured into buying it. You don't want to be in our position right now, so that is why I am writing this. It is a horrible feeling to be stuck and stranded, even the keyfob wasn't working. No, it is not us forgetting to the shut the door, or keeping a light on. All the lights, radio, defroster everything is turned off before we shut the car off, but it is as if the car isn't shutting off?  We started videoing and recording this too as evidence. Toyota needs to read these reviews and take them seriously before consumers take actions towards them.
