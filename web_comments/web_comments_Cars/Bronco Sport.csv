Great and so far I have no regrets purchasing my Bronco Sport Badlands.   Better than I expected. Rides and handles well in the snow and torrential rain.
Loving it so far!! Very new tho. Can't wait to see what adventures I will be taking it on. Very comfy and has zoooom power.
"I have told my husband, kids and fur babies that my Bronco Sport is at the top of my list now of things i love…They are now second, third and fourth in line…Just kidding🤣 Totally love my new Bronco Sport and very happy we decided to trade in our Jeep Cherokee to buy it."
"Great car, the tech is great too. With FordPass you can start it from your phone, check oil life, and see tire status. Great on gas, overall a great car. Go get one!!"
I have owned many vehicles in my life but the bronco sport badlands is by far one of the best most reliable vehicles I have ever owned.
Great to have the Bronco back in the lineup.  It is stylish and a great value. We love the four wheel drive options and the overall size of the vehicle.
"Ford hit this one out of the park on looks.  I’ve got the Badlands in Area 51 blue/gray and I’m getting a lot of comments, all good.  The interior is extremely well thought out with many useful additions such as:  hidden storage, clips, molle straps, lift gate lights and even a bottle opener on the lift gate.  Small touches really matter!"
I have always wanted to own a Bronco and I couldn’t be more impressed. Ford did their homework and did not disappoint. I love the way it drives and looks. I have received a lot of compliments on mine. Well done Ford!
"Great gas milage, reliable. Love the way it handles. Perfect for going off road to do birding and photography. Plenty of room for all my gear."
"Car ride good for 3 cyl engine is a gas saver with power the only problem is going above 45 mph it has a wind sound in the rear window that even dealer ship can’t find what’s the problem, waiting for Ford to see what’s wrong with that noise."
"It’s only been a few days so far, and I’m still learning all the different functions, but so far so good. Really enjoying the new ride."
"Ford what took you so long! 

I bought 2021 big bend Broncos sport. Wow I give this Broncos A plus. Great ride ,lots of room inside,great color ,great looks,lots of safety feathers and great gas mileage."
"Fun, peppy and stylish. Many high tech and safety features. also a hoot to take offroad even if not an experienced off roader. Remote start feature nice"
This car meets all of my expectations and is super cute fun to drive reliable and has a lot of features. Very comfortable and roomy
"The Ford Bronco Sport is a great vehicle! It has a sleek design, is extremely roomy and comfortable, and handles beautifully! This Bronco was purchased for our daughter and she absolutely loves it! Extremely happy with this vehicle!!"
"My Bronco Sport has exceeded my expectations and am so pleased with our decision to purchase it.  It is smooth to ride in, fun to drive and gas mileage is awesome.  We are looking for new road trips weekly just to get out and drive."
Got the Badlands model and couldn’t be happier. Has plenty of power and the extra traction options are great and the safety options are real nice.
This car was definitely an upgrade from what I had. It has some great features and looks super awesome! The technology is amazing with remote start and diagnostics from my phone and the different G.O.A.T. modes.
This car is a real head turner getting a lot of compliments from others that see it.  It is very sharp looking vehicle and a break from the cookie cutter looking SUV’s that are predominant on the road
For the highway or the mountain trail this vehicle suits my every need.  From the  comfortable ride on the highway to the down and dirty mountain roads the vehicle performs extremely well. I really enjoy driving the Bronco Sport.
My Bronco Sport is a smooth ride and is very fuel efficient. I love the Eco Boost. It has plenty of room and  great features. The sporty exterior design is a real head turner.
Over all the car appearance is stylish. The performance of the engine is great and handling is fine. The interior design of Bronco Sport is top notch.
"This Bronco Sport is a good looking vehicle, has everything I wanted, a good engine, accessories  and the right size for me and my needs.  I’m looking forward to driving it during our Michigan winters!"
This is the first SUV I have had as my commuter vehicle. I absolutely love it. It is rugged and totally built Ford tough for real.
It surprised me .. the comfort comfortable ride. I put over 500 miles on it the first week. ( and my wife really likes it.
"This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned,, it met all my expectations and then some, the head room, the leg room, the comfort and overall performance, Ford hit a home run with this baby Bronco."
Good gas mileage.  More options than I will use.  It is a fun and cool looking vehicle.  It certainly gets a lot of looks from people.  I have also received a lot of complements on my vehicle.
Car is great.  Excellent gas mileage for an suv.  Plenty of storage room for size of vehicle as well.  Rides better than an old Cadillac.
This is a GREAT vehicle with many great options and totally fun to drive!!! I highly recommend it great on gas mileage and the bomb on sportiness
"We set off in search of a used F150 and bought one. While waiting for our out of state paperwork the dealer lent us a Bronco Sport. Well, that was it, game over. We ordered one the way we wanted it not too frilly.
  Styling and build quality is outstanding. Hard to believe its a 3 cylinder?! You wouldn't even guess, its got plenty of pep for a fairly heavy little goat with good mpg. I didn't understand the marketing having two types of Broncos at first but actually its genius. A wrangler pick up makes as much sense as a 4wd el camino after all.
 Pricing was very fair even at full msrp! 1st new car I ever purchased that was worth the same as when I drove it off the lot as had offers for it even then. No! Its mine!"
"Awesome car.  Nothing I don’t like about it!  You’ll fall in love too.  Beautiful design, roomy, handling is excellent.  Color I got is called Area 51 and trust me, it’s gorgeous!"
"I bought the Base model, which means not top of the line in terms of comfort (think cloth seats and manual seat adjustment vs leather and push-button), although perfectly acceptable for the price point. It handles well, good acceleration, feels roomier inside than you would expect for a smaller vehicle and looks good. Since I've only had it 3 days, I can't really assess reliability yet, but there wasn't an N/A option."
It’s a Small suv. Great on gas. Pick up is pretty good. Looks amazing. Priced a little bit high in my eyes but didn’t stop me from buying.
more interior room quieter ride excellent response seats more comfortable  lots of bells and whistles but very user friendly overall its a better  suv than the Cherokee Trailhawk 2015 that I traded for
"I have had my Badlands with the 2.0 engine for a month now. I look for excuses to drive it. Great quiet ride, excellent acceleration, beautiful leather interior and ready for serious camping! Ford thought of everything when they designed this car, down to the built in bottle opener in the back. The Area 51 Blue color is gorgeous as is the up graded leather interior. Gas mileage is incredible, I use the normal mode, would be better in the Eco mode. My only complaint is, dealers need to have a sit down class to learn all the electronics in the car. The manual is over 400 pages and not to clear in sections in my opinion. Not everyone is a computer nerd. Congratulations to Ford engineering, they hit a grand slam home run!"
"Great suv comfortable and roomy, has a lot of power for a small engine .Paint  job is great ,blue leather interior is a nice touch .All around I’m very happy with it."
"I was blinding by the popularity of this truck, I am not going to lie.
I LOVE how the Bronco turns heads & that there are not too many on the road.  My Bronco came with drama like most things that are popular do. One dealership told me the three Broncos that they had were not for sale & that I was not able to even test drive them, I thought ""WHAT??"" 

Then it became a vendetta to own a Bronco. When I finally found a dealership willing to let me test drive one, I don't know if I was more about getting a Bronco by any means  at this point or if I really liked it.

I purchased the base stock example model with 2435 miles on it, so I figured it had been broke in some.  What was included cloth seats *not heated, weather floor mats, *no XM radio (which drives me crazy on my long drives) *no tinted windows (the dealership tint my windows). NO PUSH START, Key FOB. :-(.

Now I have 5,895 miles on it. This car at first glance looked just like my 2006 Honda Pilot, but smaller. I have so far had to take it in for a recall: *""for the rear suspension modules that may not be fully secured to the subframe, which may increase the risk of an accident. The defect: rear suspension modules with loose or missing bolts.""""

So in the service bay the Bronco goes, the dealership took over three hours to look at it. While waiting for service I overhear the worker say, ""I don't even know what to look for"". After three hours I was told ""ok it looks good"".  I had doubts.

Now I hear this rubbing noise in the back like a howling  could it be the rear breaks? (Thought not this early no way.)  Another thing happen that alarmed me, my lights inside/outside all came on & stayed on & then I was not able to turn it off with the key fob, I had to put the key in the ignition to get the car to turn off the lights. 

I don't know if it would run down the battery or not, but for a new car I was alarmed. I plan on calling the dealer for another service date. I am  planning on trading this in for the ""REAL BRONCO"" not totally in love with my Sport AKA the Little Sister Bronco."
"It ride very smooth, the shadow black color gets tons of compliments, feel very safe in it.  The trunk has great space and a nice wipeable layer."
Test drove prior to purchase and enjoyed the comfort and gas mileage.   Staff very friendly and nice to work with.    Will go back with any further purchases
We’ve had this car for a week and it has been a very fun car to drive.   The pickup in it for a smaller engine has been better than expected.   My only knock would be the steering wheel isn’t as nice as I would expect in an SUV in this price range.  Overall very happy and impressed.
"For those looking for a Bronco....keep looking. This is for the suburban Disney dads who almost bought a mini van and refers to ""him""self  as a ""diy kinda guy"".
Really disappointed in a vehicle that had some grit to be just a typical ""I wear north face and love kayaking with my beard and skinny jeans"" kinda of suburban dad."
"This is the first new car I have owned, and I love it! It is sporty, like a little Tank, and the headlights are awesome. It looks a bit mean and intimidating coming at you! Interior is great, very functional. Perfect for pushing through the snow and all my off roading!"
The car gasket all my needs  .I am able to drive  in snow easily.  Handles great and  gas mileage is incredible  . Makes easy for road trips
I had it for 1 week the low oil pressure light came on. It's been at the dealer ship for 11 days cause they have to get the diagnostic tool In for this vehicle. It's coming from Mexico but because of the weather in Texas it has delayed the part.  I'm over waiting.
"I purchased my Bronco sport last week and it has been the easiest transition of my car buying life. It is smooth , pretty, peppy, and all around a great suv. The value is unmatched, ford was very thoughtful in the design. I'm 6ft tall and have at least 6 inches of head room which to me is a big bonus. I could go on and on about the things I love but to sum it up I'm very pleased with everything this vehicle brought to the market."
"I've traded in a Mercury Mariner Hybrid that had 238K miles and I own a 2018 Escape.  The Bronco Sport sits higher, which gets me out of oncoming lights in my eyes,  it is quick and it looks fantastic."
"I'm mostly posting this because it doesn't seem to have happened to anyone else. Completely dead and locked up, even the keys stuck in the ignition. 

Ford knows it's electrical. Bought it 3 weeks ago, put about 700 highway only miles on it. Sat all day Saturday, tried to leave Sunday and the instrument panel is dead and won't even attempt to start. 

2021 bronco sport base model.  Was very nice.
Will update when it's solved."
"I've been waiting for the Bronco to come out for years and I have to say I was a little disappointed when I checked it out. I did not test drive or purchase this car so my review is NOT based on the performance. I looked at the Bad Lands and the Big Bend.

First thought of the Ford Bronco Sport is that its sporty looking, what was Ford waiting for? I popped the hood and it seemed wonky coming up like the hinges would give you a problem if you off roaded your SUV. Next would be the interior, I looked at the Big Bend and the Bad Lands and I was so sad to see how cheap it felt inside. It had lots of head room and leg room but the dash, console, and plastic door panels felt like it would not last long. I wish the center console were bigger for more shoulder room. Did I mention the cup holders? There weren't many and none that would fit a large cup or bottle.

II liked the engine bay, it would be easy to work on this yourself if that was ever needed. The seats had a neat feature with zippers and molle loops in the rear. The overall look is great! 

I will consider purchasing one next year if some interior features are updated."
"At long last it has arrived!  We ordered our Ford Bronco Sport Badlands Edition in Kodiak Brown back in July/August.  It just arrived to our local dealer last week and now sits in our driveway.  Love the styling; it really feels much bigger than it is when you are behind the wheel.  As someone who is 6'3, I do feel comfortable with head clearance and room within the front.  No other vehicle within this category accommodates.  The backseat is tight in terms of leg room for adults, unless one moves up the front seats.  All the technology and creature comforts blend well with the rugged/beefy look of the vehicle.  We haven't gone on a long drive yet, but already I am so much happier with this as compared to our 2014 Jeep."
Went to go buy one after months of waiting and what a disappointment. Sooo small.  Teenage girl car.   Have seen 3 on the road in the city since I drove it and all have been driven by girls.
"Very capable crossover vehicle. Great looking exterior with a surprisingly comfortable and roomy interior. Multiple USB ports and wireless pad for charging your phone. Ford sync is the best car / phone sync I have used.

Four wheel drive is great so far for Seattle area rain. Have not used it yet off road, but there is not anything that tells me it won’t be capable."
"Wow! I went in to my local dealer kinda sorta interested in one last week. After the test drive I was instantly sold on it and had it delivered to me on Saturday AM!

So far I’m loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It’s a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I’m not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven’t seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I’m not crazy about, it is the “Auto-Stop” function that shuts down the car at lights. I’m really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven’t used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I’ve mostly stayed in “standard” mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I’m not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles. 

Super stoked that I was able to get it soooooooo easily and quickly when I’m seeing online that a lot of people are having trouble! I looked at one on Tuesday and they had me the model I wanted delivered to my work on my break Saturday! Paperwork took 15 minutes...they drive my trade in away and that was that!

Absolutely in love with it so far!"
"Love the 2021 Bronco Sport Big Bend edition! Has a great look and wonderful performance. So glad Ford reintroduced the Bronco after 24 years in hiatus. This is the first Ford I’ve bought in over a decade, but couldn’t resist the new, stylish Baby Bronco."
"THE 2021 FORD BRONCO 
OPENS YOUR PAST AND TAKES YOU TO YOUR PRESENTS.
BRONCO STANDS FOR TOUGH .....ON OR OFF ROADS
THE STYLE AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPORT SUV FASHION"
