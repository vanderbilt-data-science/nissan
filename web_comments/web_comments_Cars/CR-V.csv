"liked my 2018 cr-v better only because  the gas mileage was fantastic. hopefully more miles on my 2021 will make it better. overall, 2021 vehicle was a tad better. if all things are status quo i'll probably get another cr-v when i'm ready. Mohawk Honda was fairly easy to work with"
"Love this little car.   Ride as good as a BMW we had.  Gas mileage better than expected, would like better way to have backup key."
"Excellent vehicle.  I was driving 2018 Honda CRV Touring.  Enjoyed this vehicle.  Normal service, gas mileage were as promised.  Comfortable driving.  My wife and I shared the same opinions in owning and driving a CRV Touring, we purchased a new 2021 Honda CRV Touring."
"The styling, handling, comfort and features of the Honda CR-V are top notch. It is the safest car I have ever owned. Mileage is averaging 30 city and 38 highway! Smooth ride, modern controls and plenty of room. Honda has risen to the top of the class in SUVs."
The exterior is sleek and the red CR V color is an eye catcher.  The interior amenities are abundant and standard on the vehicle.  I couldn't ask for more !
The truck is very nice beautiful love the room heated seats and the sunroof push start just a nice truck I love it my first truck I ever had as mine
This is my second CR-V and I had an HR-V previously. I am very pleased with the performance of this vehicle. I purchased the EX-L  model and very happy with it.
This is a great little car at a reasonable price. Before we decided on Honda we looked at many other SUV type makes and models. By comparison we felt the Honda CRV gave us the most for the best price.
"Love my car!! its so roomy, comfortable, and reliable!! Love the smooth ride, color, interior, and all the features!! My first new car, and I love it!!"
This car meets my expectations and then some. Love the standard heated seats!!! And the blind spot notification. I don’t feel “boxed in” like I have in other vehicles.
"One of the best values around, the staff at Frank Brown Honda did an amazing job making the process simple. The 2021 CRV EX is - very reliable and comfortable vehicle."
"So far so good! The CRV EX is roomy, has plenty of get up and go and is a great value for the money. The only feature I wish it had is the power lift gate but for the money , not a dealbreaker. It has ever other feature you could want!"
Love my new car.   The salesman and the dealership were very helpful and patient and answered all of my questions.   I've owned Honda's for over 30 years and continue to be impressed by their value and reliability.
We chose this car because it is spacious and comfortable for a car in this qqqQeclass. The interior is very attractive.  I am happy we
"Reliable, plenty of room, stylish, and AWD.  Needed a car we can count on for our daughter whilst at nursing school in Rhode Island.  We have purchased Hondas for the past 30 years.  Still driving a 2005 Accord.  Brand you can trust your families safety in."
Only been a few day but I am very impressed. Drives great and handles very well. It fits 5 peopl with plenty of leg room
"I’m so happy I upgraded my CRV to the touring model. It’s a wonderful car. It may not be larger than the EXL model but it feels bigger and more substantial. So far, this has been a perfect car!!"
It was exactly what I was looking for in a smaller SUV. I chose the touring version because I really like the extra touches and accessories that it offers.
"This vehicle as met all my needs and more, plenty of leg room and cargo space to hold any thing you need to transport and I love it"
"This car met all of my needs, Plenty of POWER...COMFORTABLE and ECONOMICAL and nice size for parking in NYC! The Touring Model has all the bells and whistle you'll ever need!"
I haven't purchased a new vehicle in 20 years.  This car is perfect!  I've had a 2012 for lots of years and this vehicle is more than I could ask for.  I love it!
I’ve owned CRV’s before so I’m a third time repeat buyer. They have always been good cars and they get me through northeast Ohio winters safely witch is a big deal for me as I am a nurse and drive a lot.
"I love my new Honda CR-V . It is so comfortable and has such a smooth drive!  It also has great gas milage which is important to me because I do a lot of driving! I really love this car and know I will enjoy it for many many years!  My last Honda has over 200,000 miles and now my Mom is driving it!  HONDA's are GREAT!!!!"
"The acceleration overall is good, but for some people would be a little sluggish. The infotainment could be more user friendly, but I love the safety features of the EX and they are well worth the extra money. Why they put automatic seat controls only on the driver's side is perplexing, but not that big of a deal. The cargo space is great, and is the main reason I went with the CR-V. The CR-V is easy to drive and the Sonic Gray paint is georgous! The difference in technology between my 2015 Honda and the CR-V is remarkable. You can't go wrong with a Honda."
This car is perfect for me and I love driving it.  It includes all the features I wanted and it was simple to navigate through the Honda Link system.
"I have had a Honda Civic and recently purchased my third CR-V. Love the styling, the comfort and the feeling of safety when I am driving it."
"My first Honda. Love it. Felt comfortable first time I sat in it. Taking awhile to get used to all the electronics (my other car was 10 hrs old) 
Could use a little more storage compartments inside. Otherwise a great car. Glad I bought it"
The car has great leg room and storage room in the back. Love the sunroof and comfort! Easy and fun to drive. I love the design and look!
"Everything we wanted in a SUV, we found in the CR-V. It has enough power and a nice interior as well as Exterior. It fits our needs perfectly."
This vehicle meets all of my current needs. Very comfortable ride! From beginning the process to finalizing the deal was a a wonderful experience! Go visit Bill if you are looking for a new ride.
The car was very excellent and I enjoyed riding in it it handles great it's one of the better cars that I bought and I bought many of them
"Have only owned our new CR-V for a day, but loving it so far. Very comfortable to drive. It’s nice and spacious, great trunk space.

Tomorrow will be the big test, as I’ll be taking our dog for her first ride!"
I have no doubt I'm going to thoroughly enjoy driving my new Honda CRV EX with AWD.  Honda thought of everything a driver would want when they designed this vehicle.
"Easy to drive, good gas mileage, comfortable, reliable, good looking, good price, what more can you ask. Most of my friends and family drive Honda!"
"I'm so happy I chose to go with Honda. The CRV is sporty and looks small. However, it's very roomy inside. The fact that the seats in the back lift of to transport tall items, is a plus."
"Love it so far. Comfortable, sporty, comes with a lot of bells and whistles. Like the keyless entry and all the safety features. Great for commute or long drives."
The car had all the options I wanted. Pleased with all the safety features. Great gas mileage so far too! Love the latest blue color Aegean Blue!
Have the space to carry most supplies.  The fold down rear seats give me extra space for loading my work projects.  I like the new safety feature for the blind sides and the lane controlling.
"This SUV met all of my needs. It’s very spacious and comfortable riding as a driver or a passenger.  Great on gas. Quality, cost of ownership, and Reliable is what I was looking for and exactly what I got after signing my paperwork and driving off the car lot."
This vehicle is a great combination of economy and room for shopping and carrying things you need on a trip. The visibility is awesome. And it is very quiet.
This car has everything we needed and met all our desires . Very stylish and we love the color. It has alot of legroom and very comfortable.
"This car meets all of my needs, I enjoy driving it and love all of the features.  Love the moon roof, tinted windows, body style"
This vehicle is very similar to the one I traded in for it with the exception this one is All Wheel Drive. I had nothing but praise for the vehicle I traded in and I expect this one to be the same.
"Has all comforts, USB cable, roof top window,  leather seat, wide space for legs, stereo sound is excellent. In general worth of buying. Can fit in small gap."
"It has all the fancy bells and whistles I wanted. Super sweet touch screen display,  moonroof, multiple angle rear view camera,  heated front seats. Great leg and head room! AND the cargo space is great! Privacy shade came included. Accelerates and breaks beautifully."
"Just purchased the car yesterday so still getting used to it, but so far I like it.  Roomy interior and nice design.  Handles well and fun to drive."
It is comfortable and roomy. Excellent handling and smooth ride. Dashboard easy to read. Impressed with safety features . I love the color and interior of my CRV
"This CRV model provides us with  greater visibility of the road ,it is fully equipped with all the safety features and a easier way of carrying items than a sedan."
"Its excellent on gas, and very comfortable on the highway, and its got alot of room for storage, great pick up in Sport mode. Great buy."
I have always wanted a CRV but put everything before my wants.  Now is my time and it is fabulous.  You sit u nice and high but don’t have to climb in!
"This car was beyond my expectations. We just love the ride, looks and features. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Such a smooth and easy car to drive."
Great road handling and speed pick up when merging into traffic. Very easy to control and a very enjoyable driving experience. Would recommend Honda to everyone.
Love the handling and the drive. What is best about Honda vehicles is the MPG. Probably the best in the industry.  Also love the color and added detailing. Superior selection for the price.
"A lot to learn with all that’s on the screen it just takes some time .
The cat works fine my wife didn’t hear the difference until I pointed it out"
First day I’ve owned my CRV and I’m very impressed. happy in my first couple of hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’  Just thrilled as heck !!!!!!  I’m a happy gal in Connecticut.
"We love the updated features, especially the safety features, on our new CRV. We keep coming back for the CRV because it's such a reliable car and meets all of our needs for size, style and comfort."
We really like the color and the room that it has. We like the deal we got and look forward to the service over the next few years.
"The handling is superb, it is comfortable and roomy.  We have all the cup holders and charging ports we need.  The safety features are exactly what we need with a new driver in the family."
"I traded my 2018 CRV EXL for a 2021.  Nearly identical.  Only significant difference is poorer fuel mileage by nearly 4 miles/gallon,  but pleased with the CRV.  It is my 5th one"
"Great car, long time Honda owner, owned Toyotas, Fords,Jeeps,Chevys, and several other models but can't beat Hondas for comfort, reliability, quality.  All Honda dealerships have excellent service departments especially ""Honda Of Covington (Louisiana)"""
Loaded with alot of electronics and convenience and safety features.Turbo engine provides ample power.Very happy with the car and its performance.Its quiet inside with no road noise
Pleasant to drive. Controls are easy to use. Seats are comfortable. No passengers so far but I think they will be comfortable. Visibility is good.
I love Hondas.  This is my 5th brand new Honda & 3rd brand new CR-V.  Engine is emitting fumes into cabin & gas going into oil badly.  Honda cannot diagnose.
Honda CRV's have been my vehicle of choice for over 25 years and my new 2021 meets all my requirements.  They have always been excellent all around vehicles.
"I have been driving a Toyota Rav4 since 2007 which is a great testimony as to the reliability of that car, (166,000 Miles), but.....the New 2021 Honda CR-V is just plain awesome.   The EX model has all the safety features that I wanted and the technology really personalized this car to fit ME.    I highly recommend this car as it has about everything one could want.   From the lumbar driver seat to the bluetooth integration of your phone and google maps, its all there.   You will not go wrong purchasing this vehicle."
I love the new red color!! The seats are adjustable so you can fit the seat to you! Leg room in the back.. even for adults!
"This vehicle is so nice. Interior to exterior beautiful. Drives great, so many amenities. Absolutely love this vehicle!!! Nice and roomy and comfortable. So happy with this purchase."
Really enjoying my new vehicle.  Handles great.  Lots of seating and leg room.  Getting used to all the new safety features.  The hatch has plenty of room.   I am really enjoying being up higher after driving sedans for years.
"I am a long time CRV owner ( I previously owned a 1998 and still owe a 2009). I have watched the design change over the years. I  don't like the engine idle feature nor the design of the console. Being a woman, you like to have your purse close, in my prior CRVs I could have it next to me on the floor, now I have to put it in the back seat. I have been able to drive my previous vehicles for over 200k miles that's why I've stuck with the CRV line. I hope that for my new 2021."
"After owning Civics and Accords, I decided I needed something a little roomier, so stepped up to the CR-V.  It doesn't disappoint.  The ease of driving and seeing cars around you  is excellent.  I feel very safe in my new Honda CR-V."
This car is roomy. Has a turbocharger for power. Rides well. A great safety rating. Comes in beautiful colors. This is our fourth HONDA  CRV and this is the prettiest and most comfortable yet plus we got a great deal at GREAT LAKES HONDA.
"I love the size of this car, plenty of leg room. I love the heated seats. The car drives very nice. Beautiful color and car."
Owned previous model for 12 years. Had to have another. Perfect for town and highway. Plenty of gadgets and USB ports to keep passengers happy.
This car met all our expectations. Love the color and all the features it offers. Runs well quiet and comfortable. Cant wait to take a road trip
2021 touring Crv.  3rd year driving Crv. Nice vehicle. Comfortable. Wish gas tank had 1 more gallon of capacity. USB plugs much easier to access than 2018 model.
This met all the requirements that I wanted and has the room that I wanted but most of all is higher and bigger than what I had.
Hondas are great cars.  This is my 4th Honda.  All of which where excellent cars. Never put expensive repairs on any of the cars I've owned.  Two of my previous cars were kept for 9-10 years each.  I plan on keeping this new for at least that long as well.
"If you need an small SUV that’s full of latest gadgets/features even from the lower trims,if you’re looking for fuel efficient rather than powerful engine then this is for you too.If you are a driver that is used of driving power engine cars,this is not for you.I highly recommend to those people who drives 4 cyl vehicles and those who are looking for efficient not super fast cars.So far,i’m very happy with my purchased of this vehicle."
We love the style and all the options it came with. The all wheel drive and Honda sensing will be loved by my wife.  Very pleased.
This car made it easy for me to get in it since I am short.  Being short I could adjust my driving seat perfectly.  It is nice and roomy too.
"Awesome car, smooth ride,   reliable transportation. And a lot of new updated gadgets.  Very good amazing services and I like it a lot.  I’m glad I purchased it"
"This vehicle is amazing. it drives comfortably, runs well, good on gas, very spacious. I love the car. I rexcommend this car to anyone without reservation"
This car has met all our needs in a family vehicle.  We previously owned a 2014 Honda CRV and decided to buy a 2021 Honda CRV.
"This vehicle is the most comfortable one I have ever owned! It has met all my exceptions! Plenty of room, loaded with all the safety features, fantastic looks and great fuel economy! I am sure it will met all my needs and will be a reliable suv."
Love this SUV! Super cute and sporty! Just what I was looking for after having a Pilot that I loved for many years. Was looking to finally downsize.
Thank JEFF PARHAM.. the best salesman in calumet city at ballet on river oaks Honda.. was very understanding and was able meet all my needs. I highly recommend him
It is just the right size for our needs. Considered the HRV but that was a little smaller then I was looking for . This car is the perfect size.
"Good features on this SUV. Easy USB location with plenty of room. Nice design inside and out. Not getting the same gas mileage as my 2019 CRV, but time will tell when the weather warms up."
"I just got the car 2 days ago but I’m in love with it, what a smooth drive and love all the features. I can’t wait to really start driving it around"
"It is a beautiful and comfortable car.  I hope it is as dependable as my last car, a 2011 CRV.  Best car I ever had!  I’m sure my new 2021 will be just as great."
"Everything is just perfect for me, the size and overall design, I love everything about it !!

"This is a great little SUV.  Somewhat underpowered but great on mileage.  Creature comforts are excellent as are the new techology features. Looks good, drives great!!"
I live in on a mountain in the country and have a dirt driveway that is a hill up to the road. This car is a tank in the snow and I can get up the driveway and down the mountain without incident. It is my favorite car so far and now that I have the EX in a beautiful metallic red I am completely in LOVE.
"It's a nice car! It has a lot if nice options. It rides nice, comfortable. It's a Hybrid so it runs on fuel and electric."
"The CR-V is very roomy and is a smooth ride.  This car has so many safety features on it, that's why we purchased it.  We still own a Honda Accord purchased new in 2006 so I know a Honda is reliable."
"It’s a safe car that’s easy for me to learn and has all the safeguards to make me feel secure in my daily trips.  I love all the safety features and how pretty it is, comfortable, good viewing and I feel safe in this car."
"This car meets my need. Love the interior, and all the new details it has. The touring is the best car if you looking for new technology and comfort."
"Great car for the money.  Lots of space. Can fit two dogs in crates in it.  One large, one medium.  Love the various ways to open tailgate.  This is my second crv."
"This car has all the modern gizmos and smart system features including Lane Keeping Assist System, Collision Mitigation System, etc. and is fuel efficient and the price is tempting; its a no brainer!"
Great for parking in tight spaces.  Fun to drive.  Touring model features match the safety and comfort features I enjoyed with my Pilot Elite.  No hands tailgate great new feature
I’ve always owned Hondas since they’ve always reliable and great looking!  The updated features only make the vehicle safer and a lot more enjoyable to drive.
"The seats are all day comfortable and the handling is very stable and predictable. So far the gas mileage is meeting or exceeding the EPA numbers. We appreciate the lights in the cargo area, heated seats and steering wheel, interior storage spaces and wireless phone charger."
"It is a good vehicle, economical, reliable, with good appearance both inside and outside, good technology, it is soft and hard for the situation it deserves, it is comfortable, I love this vehicle"
"This is my fourth CR-V (1997, 2005, 2016, 2021) and the nicest one yet.  Comfortable interior, nice ride, all of the safety/sensing features standard, and plenty of amenities for me."
