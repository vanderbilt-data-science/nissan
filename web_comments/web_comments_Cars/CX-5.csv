This car is so comfortable. QUIET! And stylish. I put a lot of mikes on my car and I want my commute to be quiet and comfortable and fuel efficient. This car has ALL THAT and enough power to pass on highways. The all wheel drive makes the car stick to the road in rain and snow.
I enjoy owning the Mazda CX-5. I previously had a 2018 Acadia.  The CX-5 is smaller but I find the trunk space has adequate amount of room for items. Since I did not need a 3rd row rather I needed a car with more trunk space this car has worked nicely. The only change I had to get use to was being closer to the ground as the Acadia is higher up. That hasn’t been too bad of an adjustment.
"I bought the Grand Touring, and it’s got everything I wanted in a new vehicle. Meets all my criteria and expectations! Still finding options that I didn’t know I had!"
"After owning several Honda’s we wanted something with more power and a more luxurious interior.  The CX-5 turbo has met or exceeded our expectations.  If you are considering a CX-5, I highly recommend getting the Turbo AWD model."
The dashboard design is the best I’ve ever driven.  It’s comfortable.  It’s fun to drive and I’m hoping it has great reliability as the reviews say.
It’s zippy and holds tight to the road while offering finishes that are downright sexy. This is not your average mid-size SUV. The stitching alone separates it from its competitors and the Bose sound system is on point.  The tech is on par with any luxury vehicle I’ve driven in the past.
"I traded my 2020 CX 5 for a 2021 and so thrilled with the newest model. They have refined the screen, tweak the transmission to where it’s really a joy to drive now.  The styling is great. It’s not too big, not too small, just right."
"I owned a 2012 CX-9 for 5 years, and was quite impressed with its reliability, handling, and overall performance. This led me to consider the 2021 CX-5. I spent a considerable amount of time researching the professional reviews. I test drove one, the competitors, and decided it would be the best value for the money. I purchased a red touring, beige interior with AWD, and the 2.5 187 HP power plant. Not only is it stylish and fun to drive, it's safety ratings,  exterior and interior features give me a feeling of confidence. Room is a bit less but adequit. The interior is linear and well balanced. The 10.25"" infotainment is easy to read, but not user friendly. The ride is comfortable, stable, and QUIET. I'm 5'11"" and slide into the cockpit comfortably ready for take off. With sensible driving and 750 miles, mileage is well above 30 mpg. I would highly recommend the CX-5 for a small family, or a single person."
"Only owned the car for 3 days. It drives and rides great. It is very luxurious, like a more expensive car. So glad I chose this vehicle."
"This car is GREAT. Drives smooth, great pickup for the engine size, crisp interior, stylish exterior. The audio is crisp and when I put the seats down I can camp in the back (I'm 6' tall)."
This car is spacious for a small family of four to five and convenient to drive and there is a lot of horse power when you needed
I love it and get a lot of compliments on it. I will continue to deal  with Mazda in the future. I recommend this dealer to anyone.
"Love the CX5, and now with the Turbo engine, it definitely has the Zoom-Zoom factor. I bought the Signature trim which has the Napa leather interior, very comfortable and I love driving it."
The Mazda CX-5 is well designed and the electronics are user -friendly.  It’s also easy to drive and comfortable.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable and impressive looking car.
This car is perfect. Plenty of leg room in the back and trunk space. I really like all the sensors.  Lane assist is awesome.  And a great back up camera.  Love my new car.  Sales rep was very kind and helpful.  She made the process so easy.
"Had the car for 4 days and so far, it has exceeded our expectations.so many safety features and entertainment options. Handles great. Happy with purchase"
"I purchased the Mazda CX-5 Carbon Edition in early May - I could not be more pleased with my purchase. The paint color is unique and eye catching, and the interior is on par with vehicles that cost $15-20K more. The CX-5 has plenty of room in both the front and back, and it has ample trunk space. At this price point, there is no competitor that comes close to matching the CX-5."
"This CX-5 is my fourth; this Mazda is my seventh. My 2019 and 2021 CX-5s have the all-around safety features. I won't drive a vehicle without these. The CX-5s are comfortable, stylish inside and out, powerful when you need it, reliable, great on gas mileage, easy to handle. No better vehicle out there -- for the safety and money."
"Perfect size, smooth drive, definitely stylish. This vehicle is equipped with so many features. This one’s a keeper!
I highly recommend stopping by your nearest dealer and taking one for a test drive."
"This car is a dream come true for me. It has plenty of fun entertainment features to make me happy without overwhelming me with too much on my dash at once. I test drove a Rav4 and while it was a nice car as well, the dash reminded me of a space ship b/c there was so much going on at once and I struggled to even locate my current speed amongst everything else. With my Mazda I can opt to keep it simple or put more information up on my dash as I want and the speedometer is never part of that particular part of the dash area so no worries about not knowing how fast I'm going. it has wonderful cruise control features that make traveling long distances on the interstate a dream come true. It's stylish and comfortable with plenty of room. The front seats recline almost to a full lay down position which is an awesome feature for me since I enjoy napping in my car on my lunch break sometimes and it makes it so much more comfortable that way. The trunk space is plenty roomy for a small family with no kids, or one kid, and i love the one touch open and close feature. the backup camera is like watching a hi-def movie it's so clear and the safety features with the lane assist and even coupled with the back up camera sensors to warn you if someone is coming along your sides that you can't see quite yet, can't be beat. the back seats can fold down in three seperate ways so that you have versatile options for transporting larger items that won't fit just in the back hatch. I've had this car for about a month now and I don't have anything bad to say about it honestly. I love everything about it and I used to loathe driving and now I love it thanks to Mazda and my CX-5."
"I bought the Signature edition and I love it!  There are so many safety features and it has higher ground clearance than my Honda CRV.  That is important in snowy Colorado. Plus, it's fun to drive!"
"Mazda has one of the highest, if not the highest,  safety record for SUV’s. I trade vehicles every 2-3 years, this is my 3rd Mazda, it’s the best vehicle I’ve ever owned."
"I own a Mazda 2016, and it’s the best car I have ever owned.  So naturally I wanted to stay with that model, just wanted an upgrade."
"Good looking, reliable, great performing vehicle. And oh so comfortable. Better than great sales experience at Wantagh Mazda. It’s got every feature you need and a few you never thought of. Very enjoyable car."
Interior and exterior are  elegant and sporty. Gas mileage is exceeding expectations now and the high tech features are fun and useful! Very quite rude!
"Love this car.  Bought the CX-5 Grand Touring with Premium Package and it has all the bells and whistles that I was looking for.  Love the Parchment color leather seats too. The exterior color, “Soul Red Crystal Metallic” is stunning."
I was confident  that I  would  like this car and I  do.  Seems a little bit roomier  which is good and the exterior  styling  is very appealing.   It looks like it could handle any road conditions  without sacrificing a safe and  comfortable  ride.
"It came with everything I was asking for, it's great on the road. You'll love the flexibility if this vehicle. My favorite thing, cooling seats, don't get me wrong I love everything about it,  but those little things make a difference."
I went from test drive to ownership in one day. This a great performing suv it really accelerates well and also handles well. The other thing this car has all the safety and convenience features as I purchased the signature edition and it’s worth the extra cost. The ride is a touch firm but acceptable for the handling it provides. This is one of the nicest cars I’ve ever purchased and they ar numerous.
This is my second Mazda CX-5. I love the car and it amenities. It is fun to drive and has good pickup for highway driving
Lots of features. Comfy. Good looking. AWD is great. Priced about half of what a comparable high end brand would be with the same features
"As many of the car magazines will tell you, there is nothing in the small SUV class that can compete with the CX-5.  The car is head and shoulders above everyone in driving dynamics. The interior finish is on par with other vehicles $10K more expensive.  
If you're thinking about buying and Audi, Mercedes, or BMW, try the CX-5 (in one of the higher trim levels) first.  You're going to be shocked"
The Mazda CX-5 CE is a beautiful car with luxury and performance . I just got it but the interior is wonderful and the safety features are super helpful. Zoom Zoom!
"I reviewed this car on another popular website. I wanted to give more details here. Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."
"Has excellent design inside and out, plus fabulous power and reliability. It is comfortable, smooth, yet very strong. Wish it had better gas mileage. I'd recommend it w/o a doubt, and Valley Stream Mazda was fantastic dealership for honesty and best deal too!"
"Not as good as we had hoped, I could change gear in a manual gearbox car quicker than this car changes, also for the money not at all good value, sad to say we are already talking about changing it for something else."
EVERYTHING OUR SALESMAN MIKE HEINTZ FROM WERNER MAZDA IN MANCHESTER NH SAID WAS TRUE. THIS VEHICLE HAS MORE STANDARD OPTIONS THEN MOST OTHERS . IT IS LUXURIOUS WELL BEYOND ITS PRICE RANGE. DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. MAKE SURE YOU TEST DRIVE THIS ONE
We were looking for an all wheel drive vehicle. We test drove the CX-5 and really liked it. It rides really nice and has a lot of safety features.
"This car has a high end style and color, it is All Wheel Drive for the traveling I am going to be doing. My car has the latest equipment, the newest safety features and accessories I want and enjoy in my car.  The seats are very comfortable and easy to adjust.  The steering wheel can be set for comfort by pulling it out or pushing it in or moving it up or down.  The steering has the controls for phone calls, cruise control and safety features with car distancing and the car has so many more features that are too numerous to mention.  It is a great driving vehicle and excellent value for the money!"
"I ended up spending a bit more and upgraded to Grand Touring Model of Mazda CX 5. Heated seats. Heated steering wheel. Moonroof. Leather interior. Very nice drive. Extremely happy with it. Only small caveats were I wish just a bit more leg room in the back seat without adjusting the front 2 seats forward.  If you floor the accelerator, the vehicle jerks a bit. Minor complaints however. Overall, very, very satisfied with the vehicle. I bought a red CX 5 and the color is awesome!!!"
"This SUV is spacious, the body of the car is luxurious, and the gas mileage is awesome! It drives like a dream and I love all the features that I can use right from the app."
This car feels like a sports car! It handles like you wouldn't believe and is an incredibly smooth ride! It has all the features of a luxury car without the luxury car price tag!
Car is a rhe smoothest car insurance have owned and is super reliable on the road. I would recommend to anyone who needs a new car..
I love everything about my new car! My first time purchasing a brand new vehicle! The best experience. I would pick my mazada over the infinity fx35 that I previously owned any day.  When it comes to all the safety features Mazad out did themselves.  You can't go wrong with a mazada!
This my 9th Mazda from Tustin Mazda and   I’ve used Larry Henderson as my sales guy almost every single time.  He really goes to bat for the customer!  This 2021 version  of the cx5 is so quiet and smooth and the screen is hi tech without being too complicated to use.  Treat yourself to one now!
"This car is very similar to the car I had, my 2014  CX 9 which was totalled in an accident 2 mos prior to this purchase.  Although I don't have that third row of seats, Its still very roomy, comfortable  as much as my CX 9 was, yet more up to date, loaded, with amenities.   I love the UPGRADE!"
"This car drives really well, and has an interesting color on the exterior. The interior red leather is also very pretty and the various mechanisms and accessories are very well designed. I need to learn how to use the electronic attachments."
Nice ride and quiet on the road. Turbo feature provides a quick response when passing. Interior features are exceptional and nice Bose sound system is a bonus
"I only have two issues that I would like to address. I am unable to use my steering wheel controls to scroll my Sirius/XM favorite channels. I am hoping that Mazda can come up with an update that will change that. 2nd- It would be nice to be able to control the cabin temperature from the My Mazda app.  Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase. I have had the vehicle 1 week today."
"Quiet, fast, luxurious, affordable, great finishes. Loving the interior and exterior details. So far, we love this car.Very spacious inside. Really loving this cute SUV"
"This car has the premium feel of my last luxury car purchase, at half the cost. I want to drive a vehicle that is safe and practical for outdoor activities while having a nice-looking car. Easy to say that a Mazda CX-5 fits that description."
"It is very responsive with the wheel and gas pedal and brakes.  I especially like the large 10.25"" Infotainment screen.  The design exterior design is very attractive with a slight agressiveness to the front grill. Nice.  Feels very solid, especially when you open and shut the front hood.  Heavy but in a good way. Top of the chart for impact ratings in its class!"
"Fun to drive. Reliable, luxury, great value, safe car. I enjoy driving it every day. Enough space for my family with two kids. I think if more people test drove it, there would be more Mazdas on the road."
"I love this car! It has all the goodies and feels like luxury vehicle with all the extras that came with it. My only wishes would be for automated folding mirrors, a larger moonroof, and roof rails. The ride is smooth and super quiet. It feels SOLID. The leatherette is very comfortable and I feel cradled in the multi adjustable seat. I love that the passenger seat has the same controls. It is a joy to drive and I look for opportunities to take it out on the road. This is my third Mazda, and I really appreciate the value and quality this brand delivers."
I was looking for an SUV that was higher off the ground than my sedan and has a quiet cabin. This Mazda CX-5 filled those needs. I was happy with the interior styling and the quality of the upholstery. There is good storage but it could use a larger cubby in the console for placing small items like my phone. Not a deal breaker. Air conditioning and heat are excellent. Audio and integrated Apple Car play are very good.
"This is my 5th Mazda and I must say, Mazda gives you a ton of amenities for a reasonable price. The new turbo engine give the car some added pep. The handling is superb and the turn radius is phenomenal. The interior cabin is well appointed and has all the bells and whistles found in high end luxury vehicles. The new Nappa leather seats are a dream to sit in. All in all it's the best deal out there for a mid size SUV. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this vehicle."
i like it. it is quicker and quieter than the previous one i had. that was the 2017 model. the star review shown above should have a very good star. the car is very good
"This car meets all my needs.  It has a great exterior design, very comfortable and sporty interior.  Amazing Bose sound system and very roomy and lots of trunk space!"
"This is my 2nd CX 5 - with new 7th generation technology Mazda has outdone even themselves. Great driving position, fabulous road manners and perfect size. I am extremely pleased with my 2021 CX 5."
"We have owned Mazda cars for years, we traded a 2016 CX-5 for an updated 2021 CX-5... Our dedication to Mazda is a reflection of the great service Orange Park Mazda provides.."
"Look no further! This is it!! Stylish, roomy, comfortable, GREAT gas mileage!! A smooth ride ( we have the Grand Touring) and we couldn’t be happier!!"
Once again Mazda has nailed it! The CX 5 is great value. The interior and all of the features are things you would only expect is far more expensive luxury cars. Handling and overall driving experience is great!
The car is beautiful and comfortable. It has great technology and the Bose radio is uncredible. The led headlights are very bright. Car rides smoothly.
"Just leased my second Mazda, a CX-5 Grand Touring (base trim - no Prem Pkg) and I'm pretty pleased so far. Having come from a 2018 CX-9 Grand Touring, the 5's ride is a bit on the firm side, but is fine. The non-turbo engine is surprisingly peppy and punchy, especially when used with the manual / paddle shifters in Sport mode. The smartphone remote feature, 10.25"" info screen and upgraded infotainment system are welcome additions, albeit one too many steps needed in the infotainment to execute relatively simple tasks. The one feature I'm disappointed with is the Bose system. It has decent sound, but comes across more muddy and muffled than I'd like, even with the available sound enhancement settings and features. To me, It just doesn't have the same crispness and depth as the Bose system that I had in the CX- 9, or those found in the Premium 3 / CX-30's I test drove (if you’re a bit of an audiophile, you might consider one of these aforementioned models). The 5 is a great CUV, and could be even better if it had the same Bose setup found in the 3 / CX-30. That would make it a home run. Maybe Mazda will up the sound game for the 5's next generation model. I'm hoping so."
"We looked at several models but were guided to the CX-5 based on expert reviews.  We had an older Mazda which helped with loyalty cash and are a fairly rare two Mazda household.  We think reviews generally are pretty accurate about the CX-5.  I wanted something in the CUV category that was not the ""corporate issue"" so the Mazda moved up the list just by being somewhat more unique that many of its top competitors.  After driving a couple of competitors, it was obvious that the CX-5 has a level of performance that is well above its peers.  I debated whether to go with the turbo but quickly disagreed with the reviews about the base engine being wimpy.  We don't plan to trailer but the CX-5 has repeatedly demonstrated more than enough power to easily pass anything else when needed. The handling is much more like a sports car (former Audi A4 owner) than an SUV.  The appearance is just plain stunning, esp. on the interior.  The Soul Red paint turns the vehicle into a head turner on the road or a parking lot.  Mazda did a nice job with the level of features at each trim level and easy increases in pricing as one steps up the product line.  We went with the Touring w/ the Premium package which has nearly all of the most important features of the higher models - other than the turbo engine.  The suite of safety features is impressive -and does increase as you go up the model line but even the Touring has stuff that will help keep you out of an accident and reduce driving stress - and it all works very unobtrusively.   I don't mind not having a touch screen infotainment center since it would require leaning forward to touch it while the controls on the center console can be easily found with the hand without looking.  The smaller interior size wasn’t as important to us but it can make the difference if you haul a lot of stuff – which we don’t.  The only disappointment so far is the Yokohama Geolander tires that are not well rated.  I haven't had any performance issues with them but I suspect better tires could bring road noise in the cabin down even further. It is also worth noting that the CX-5 is only made in Japan (Hiroshima) and has no U.S. content – if supporting U.S. industry matters to you.   
Mazda did a great job in creating a high-quality product that has some very unique characteristics in a class that is not only highly competitive but where many models stumble on one or more key attributes and still act or look a lot like each other.  
We are very happy with our new CX-5."
"Having owned several Mazda's, it's easy to perform multiple tasks without having to take your eyes off the road. Everything from making calls, picking favorites on the radio, just to mention a couple."
"This compact SUV so far is great, I have had it for 4 weeks. Seats are firm and well built, a tad snug. Nice firm ride and great handling. I have the Signature AWD and turbo engine. Not the best MPG but very good performance for its class. Storage is a little small but as much as I need. Great cameras and safety features, probably close to as good as it gets short of some advanced features and near self driving. Steering wheel warms up in just seconds though just on the sides. The heated seats are better than my old Cadillac and warm fairly quickly, warm air comes out within a mile of driving (10 second warm up) then the new remote start is nice when it has been out in the cold for several hours. For a compact SUV it has the the lineage of my Miata. Adaptive headlights are wonderful. New update infotainment system works well. Overall I chose it over a BMW, almost a rival but still the best bang for the bucks. Crystal Lake Mazda has been great to work with."
Love the car and exterior color we chose is very classy and unique.  We bought the car because it is rated the #1 SUV for its reliability and affordable pricing.
"If you are looking for a fun car to drive, look no further. This car is head and shoulders above its class. Fit and finish is premium. I cross shopped it with Acura RDX. Even though Acura was more fun to drive, Mazda gives much more for the money. I could not justify $10K extra for Acura. You can get good gas mileage if you drive it with light foot."
"For the money, you can not find another car in the price range that is comparable  in terms of luxury and driving experience. I'm actually surprised you don't see more of them on the road."
The car is very comfortable.  It's got a lot of wonderful features that I still have to learn how to use (just bought it).  Did a lot of research prior to looking.  It was rated very highly and wasn't overpriced.
"The Mazda CX-5 has everything I waned and more! Clean lines, great performance, excellent driving in all types of roads. The best car I have ever owned!"
The comfort of the seats is my favorite part which helps for long car rides! Love the heated seats and sunroof! My only wish is that the sunroof extended farther back and was electric. The control system is easy to use and the Bose speakers are amazing. This car gets great gas mileage and is so easy and fun to drive. Has lots of room in the back for storage and it helps the back seats come down. I love this Mazda and all the features! Highly reccommend!
"I bought this car for my 16 year old because of all the safety features it offered. The car is beautifully designed, and drives like a cloud. The Mazda Care package offered through Hendrick Mazda was a great way to get some extras for a great price!"
"I purchased the Carbon Turbo CX5, and I adore my new car. It had everything I requested- heater seats, tinted windows, remote start, and sun roof. It is a beautiful color, and has red leather seats (swoon). I am very very happy with my decision."
The vehicle is just a safe overall vehicle with a great ride. Love the features and the design of the vehicle. Mazda did a great job on producing the cx5
"I had a 2019 CX5 and have been very happy with it's comfort and overall performance. I read many articles about the improvements in the 2021 models. This years' model is so quiet inside and the new Bose stereo system is amazing to me. The engine has more zip and is noticeably smoother. That was hard to believe, as I was very impressed with the 2019 model."
"The only thing I don't like is no interior  lighting  with exception  to the norm . It dark at night . I'm use to some floor or side lights inside at night, Also never had to purchase  a card for navigation"
