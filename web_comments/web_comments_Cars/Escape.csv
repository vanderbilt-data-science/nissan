This car is sleek and stylish on the outside. The exterior hides a very roomy interior too. Every control is within easy reach and the interface wit Apple Car Play is easy.
"My car has a miss or jerk  at low mpr bad one.  Have taken it back to dealer 3 or 4 times, even left it there for them to drive a couple of days. They said ford was having problems with2021 escapes but there could not do anything until ford told them to .  This is my fourth escape and none of the others did this.  HELP"
"Beautiful car, very advanced safety features. a fantastic rear camera that I need because of some serious neck issues.  Just a wonderful car, I'm a long-time Ford owner."
"We have had Escapes in the past and
For
The
Money they are one of
The reliable
 Are we
Have
Owned. And
With the 1.5 liter engine it will be economical too!"
"Escape SE AWD, nice car! Surprisingly peppy for a 1.5L 3-banger, and when in Eco mode, fantastic gas mileage. I like the safety features, especially the blind-spot monitor and the backup camera. Ford has put a lot of attention to detail and everyone who has seen it find it very attractive.

Comfort is a tad under par for me, as I am not getting any younger.

It's been about 16 days since I bought it, and I keep reminding myself that I'm not in a dream.

I was very pleased by the dealer's service as a new customer and they fulfilled each of my needs, and then some. I got a full-coverage warranty for six years for great peace of mind.

Just plain fantastic."
"Nice car.  This car has a lot of nice features and it is
very comfortable and easy to adjust the seat..    It gets good gas mileage."
It has  accelerates nicely. The steering  effort is very easy compared to all the vehicles I have ever owned.  It is easy to get in and out which is a major reason for selecting the model.  It corners well. It has lots of features -the heads up displays are a real plus.
"I find the Escape to be a very comfortable riding car that has the capability of hauling lots of items in the back. The sun roof offers lots of light and fresh air.
Iâ€™m very pleased with it."
Great vehicle.  Like setting up high in car.  Easy to drive and handles well. Turns short easy to maneuver and drive.   Like color and interior design but temperature control should be on steering wheel
"Drove my 1st escape 170,000 miles with no issues. I just bought. 2021 Escape Titanium, fully equipped. A little bigger than my 2014. Better gas mileage. Very comfortable. Absolutely beautiful car."
"So far Im really surprised with the 2021 Escape in all my needs. At the dealer I test drove 4 2020 escapes and they all all had a jerky transmission shifting as so many people claim in the 2020 Escape. I test drove 2 - 2021 escapes and both shifted perfect So I ended up with the SEL model and so far hasn't had that problem, shifts very smooth and the 1.5L 3 banger really gets up and goes. All around driving MPG is getting better, Im at 24.9 MPG and climbing with 236 miles. Had a 2019 Jeep Cherokee before this and its much smoother ride, better mileage and quieter at highway speeds. I will say this comparing both, the Escape is much easier to get in and out of for a older person 88 years old, very short mother with a bad hip and shoulder. She use to have a rough time of it and she didnt want no help. The escape since is is about 2 inches lower in seat height and narrower in the door jam makes all the difference to her. Windows are lower too so she can see out better as well. I looked as MANY SUV's and my goal was to find a easy get in and out of, this was my only choice. There were a couple others made in South KOREA that would have worked for her but they were just to small for my needs. So if getting a new car or SUV is on your list this might be the one your looking for."
"Good car, but horrible dealership. Dealer never transfer the title, it has been a month since we paid. We are looking for a lawsuit for potential fraud."
