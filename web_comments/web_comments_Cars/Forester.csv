"This car is abysmal and Subaru LIED about the mpg. It's absolutely absurd. In mixed driving - cold weather, warm weather, whatever - is 20mpg. On the hwy it gets 21.5. It's disgusting. And it has ZERO pickup. It sounds like it's dying when I try to get up to speed on the hwy - much less up a hill. My previous car was an Alltrack. They claimed I woudl get 31/22. I got 33/28.5. Sure, it wasn't as good in the snow, but at least I could drive more than a week before filling up again. And I never feared for my life when trying to accelerate accross a street! So awful. But the seats are cushy!"
"I have only been leasing this car for a few weeks but I am in love! The handling, safety features, styling, and technology are all on point."
Did not answer Reliability as I just got it but the reviews are good.  So far I really - really like it!  The more i drive it the more it seems to fit me better.  Not a fan of a CVT but this has pep without using the sport drive.  Lots of nice soft surfaces in this vehicle which is really nice.  Great stereo system.  Handles really great!  Gas mileage is really good for AWD.
"We looked at Lexus, BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes SUV’s. This Forrester Touring has similar comfort but greater practicality and visibility.
The other luxury cars are clearly more comfortable and refined but not for $25K-$40K more.
We are in our mid 70’s and wanted safety and confidence in adverse weather situations. We believe this was a more intelligent choice. It also is attractive and rides quietly and nice."
Great car. Reliable. This is the third Forester and fourth Subaru we own. Won’t hesitate to continue with this make of vehicle. Staff was excellent to work with and very attentive to our needs.
"This is my 3rd Subaru Forester, I just love this make and model. It is a very comfortable car and very quiet. I have the Limited version, it has all the amenities I could ask for. My 1st Subaru I bought used, I hit a deer with it, killed the deer and no damage at all to the car or me, at that point I was sold on the superior quality of Subaru's.  On the highway I average 30-32 mpg."
"This is our 2nd Forester.  It has amazing safety features as well as ease of entry.  The doors open very wide.

We are also thrilled with the sales staff at Peoria Subaru in Peoria AZ."
This car feels very safe and seems to perform well.  I really like the great visibility.  It's the best I've tried. The car handles well in snow where others dont.
I always on American cars then I found a good deal on a used Subaru legacy then I was hooked between the fun driving these automobiles in the service behind them I recommend you give them a try
This SUV meets all our needs and gives features that we didn't even expect Being older drivers the safety and driver assist allow us to feel very safe behind the wheel.
"This car is going to be around for a while! We got it because of the all wheel drive, but it has so much more to offer: heated seats, x-mode, apple/android auto. I can auto start my car from my phone, I have the convenience of the truck with a smooth ride. I used to live Honda because of the buttery drive, my Subi drives super smooth too. Subi knows their value and I think they care about the customer and their safety first, everything else falls in place because of that."
"The Subaru Forester (Touring Model) is a very sharp looking vehicle. The interior has a lot of space and the sound system is awesome. It also has many safety precautions. I have only owned it for a few months, but so far, I love it!"
Car is comfortable with good space. It is quiet with a smooth ride. Sound system is fantastic. Looking forward to trips in our new car.
"This Forester has great style, tons of cargo room and handles like a dream on all types of terrain!  So glad I made this purchase."
This is my second Subaru Forester I like the Foresters driving performance.  Great in winter weather with snowy roads. Very smooth ride.  I would consider another one for my next car.
I love all of the extras on my new car! Safety was my priority. Great safety features and love the look. It’s an SUV that feels more like a car. I don’t feel like I’m driving a truck.
"Had never seriously considered a Subaru. After some research, had decided on purchasing a used VW Alltrack. Checked dealer Web site again the morning i planned to purchase the VW and on a whim, browsed Subaru. 1st pic that came up was interior of a 2021 white Forester Sport. Perhaps because I was coming from a VW Passat known for its very conservative styling, I was instantly smitten w the Forester interior. After doing some more research I decided on the Forester. I bought it used w about 2.4K mikes on it. It served as a demo car. I feel the $27k price was quite fair. 

Visibility is amazing. I’m 6’3” and there is still plenty of headroom left. The tall side glass and clever side mirror placement and extra triangle glass makes seeing out a breeze. Even rearward visibility is great. The extra large sunroof makes for an even airier environment. I will say the front seat bottom is just long enough. Any shorter and for me it would be an uncomfortable ride. If your inseam is longer than 36” the seats might be uncomfortable for you. While the back seat bottoms are just long enough for most, and the area is very roomy my legs couldn’t endure a king ride back there. But again I’m quite tall so it shouldn’t be a problem For most. Those who have rode in the back find it very comfortable and enjoy that the seating height is higher than in front giving them a great view ahead. Cargo room is what i really love.  W the seats down, I can fit my 2x bike in there without removing the wheels. That’s a big deal for me.  

I find the power more than sufficient for the vehicle type and my mainly commuting purposes. I find the acceleration very responsive when I apply smooth steady pressure to the gas pedal. Punching the pedal, for me, resulted in a brash take off that seemed slower overall than when I apply a steady foot. I just took my first road trip, 600 miles, and now it seems the vehicle is broken in and the responsiveness is even better. Currently have about 4.2k mikes on it. 

This Sport came w the upgrade package that incl Harmon sound, auto back up monitor and braking and power lift gate. The suite of safety features is complete - lane departure, auto braking to emergency stop, adaptive cruise. The cruise works very well and accelerates very well when the car slows down for slower traffic and then finds sufficient open space to increase speed. Over the month I’ve had it I’ve learned how to manage the safety features and drive in such a way that it’s not annoying at all. Doing simple things like always signaling when changing lanes prevents the steering wheel from bucking back against your steering inputs. The torque vectoring allows for snappy handling when switching lanes and the turning radius is very tight and makes for great parking lot maneuvering.

I love driving this CUV. I recent sat in a family members Rogue and then another’s CRV. I left both thinking I’m so glad I got the Subaru. When I see VW Alltracks drive by, I thank my lucky stars I did not get it. I highly recommend this vehicle."
"Besides the outside appearance, is the safety of the vehicle. All the safety features, gas savings, roomy and all the benefits that you can, i.e. service, maintenance and so on."
Very few problems and very dependable. The 2015 was trade in for the new 2021 Forester which I believe will be even a better car.
Just purchased the vehicle yesterday.  After test drive liked the ride and will update after driving it for a few months.  At this point I would recommend the Forester to others seeking to purchase a new car.
"This car meets all my needs and has the best safety rating! Suburu is a car that I trust and feel safe in!!
Glad to be part of the Subaru family!"
"I just purchased my 2021 Subaru Forester Limited which has a lot of options. aI only have 101 miles on it. I'm am 4'9"" and I can see over the steering wheel without being on top of the wheel.  The features seam awesome, and I love the power liftgate. It rides excellent.  I am very happy with this car so far."
"We have owned for only a few days, but the car has all of the features we need, great room front and back and great comfort."
"I couldn't be happier with my 2021 Subaru Forester.  I purchased the Limited trim package and just love it!  I thought my previous car, a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe had lots of bells and whistles, but my new Forester seems even more luxurious.  It's a much smoother ride.  The road I live on is dirt and has lots of ruts, but I don't bounce around as much as in my old vehicle.  The only thing I don't like is how loud the seat belt reminder is.  It starts chiming as soon as I start the engine and quickly becomes progressively louder and louder and louder, which I find very annoying."
The car is perfect size for my wife and I. We like all the safety features and the car feels solid when you’re driving it. The ride is great and it handles very well. All the features are easily accessible the car is easy to use.
"We purchased the Touring model as it included all the safety features as standard.  In addition, this car gets better gas mileage on the highway than my previous Subaru.  Would I purchase another Subaru?  Yes, as this is the 6th Subaru we have owned.  Great car."
"Best Subaru we’ve owned. It compares most favorably to our best car ever - our Volvo 850 from long ago!  Love the handling, seating comfort, sound system - great car!"
"This car meets my needs of comfort seating, leg room,
Traveling space and room for grandkids!!with all the new gadgets I need to learn I’m sure we will be extra safe."
"This is my first time owning a Subaru and I am very impressed with everything they have to offer. I feel super safe, comfortable, and current with all the available new tech. I like the way they monitor the car constantly and really treated me great during my buying experience. And, this SUV is great on gas too."
The perfect size for me. It handles well  and the controls are easy to operate. Great gas mileage. Super comfortable. Reasonably priced and looks beautiful!
I really like this car and feel really safe in it! I highly recommend it if you have children too!  The sensors are excellent and the lane safety features are great for someone like me who does a lot of commuting!
Has a wonderful look and drives wonderfully. I also love all the safety features.  This is my second forester.  Had a cross trek in between but do like forester better.  Easier to get in and out of and more cargo space
Perfect car for me at this point of my life.  Maybe i should not have waited so long.....  It will help my navigate snowy winters and small grandchildren.
"This car is great!  Roomy, controls are easily accessible, the visibility is great, it handles well and is easy to park.  I test drove some of the competitors and found this the best.  Also my insurance rates are lower with this model versus the competitors."
I love my Forester Sport so far. I do not even have 1000 miles on it and I am averaging 31 MPG in mixed driving. Very comfortable car as well!
"Love my new Forester, unbelievable all the extras the base model has!  Comfortable drives very nice, learning more about it daily!  Thank you Colleen at Horne Auto in Show low az!! You made this happen!! She is great!"
"This is my 6th! Subaru.  I happen to lease every 3 years.
They have updated 2021 Forester.  Larger and more styled
which I appreciate while keeping safety at its core."
"I always wanted to have a Subaru. I didn’t know if I would have it as my first buy car. But I’m so glad I went with it, and the forester itself has so much space and is very comfortable for me and when I have passengers."
This vehicle has all of my needs which care safety first. Than reliability. Value for your money. And well designed interior.  I fell in love with the two tone seats. It drives like a dream.
"Ladies preference for a vehicle which has all of the required features to assist with safety. Cameras are nicely positioned and the lane control, automatic braking and subsequent acceleration when the the cruise control is on is very helpful. Hopefully this SUV will last a long time."
"Will advise upon further driving ,found that the extra elements for upgrade are a little pricey right now but are of specifications from the Manufacturer ."
"I've been driving a Chevy Silverado for two years and decided we needed something more efficient on fuel.  After test driving several vehicles,  comparing fuel and safety features it was a no brainer to go with this new Forester."
Love the features!!! Easy to handle!!! Happy thus far!!! Smooth ride/ comfortable seats / spacious/ awesome privacy blind / amble rear seat space/ beautiful rims !!!
"Former Honda owner (for 21 years) and made a change after seeing a decline in the overall Honda product.  I have owned my Forester for one month, have over 2,100 miles on it now and love everything about it, with one exception, the seat belt (that is the reason for 4 stars on comfort).  I wish the latch was longer - it has taken some getting used too - but that is my only complaint.  Ride is great, handling unbelievable and solid and don't pay any attention to the complaints about power and acceleration - it gets you where you need to go without any problems.  I look for reasons to drive the car.  My only regret is that I did not make the change sooner."
This is my third Forester.  It is a reliable car that fits my needs perfectly.  I love the new headlights that see around a corner and the seat comfort.  The cargo space is bigger than most cars in this class.  It just drives well on short and long trips.
It has everything I wanted in a car.  Absolutely love this car.  This is my second Subaru Forester.  He handles well on the road and is great on gas.
"Considering my old car didn’t even have Bluetooth, I’m in heaven. No blind spots, it has intermittent wipers! So much more than I’ve ever had. Excellent car!"
Very happy with our new Subaru Forrester 2021. It is meeting all of our needs and is a pleasure to drive! Feel very safe as well!
This car rides smoother and has plenty of leg and head room. The Cabin is quiet compared to other vehicles we have owned.  Very pleased.
"Only weeks old but seems to be an excellent vehicle. Enormous number of new technical/operational controls. As I become familiar with them, I find them to be extremely helpful."
This is my second Forester. I was a long time Toyota owner but now that I have switched to Subaru I don't think I'll  ever go back.  The Forester has superior AWD making it easy to handle  and the boxy shape increases the driver's viewing capability. I hope this never changes!
"Safest, better resale, reliable, very best Eye Sight  feels like driving down a velvet tunnel. All wheel drive makes handling great even if you don’t go off road. They keep making important safety and design upgrades. I have driven rentals, family and friends cars over the years and Subaru is the best all around and at an affordable price."
"Always loved the Forester so I finally got one and I'm thrilled! It's a great car; roomy, great visibility, high level of safety and great standard features on the Limited edition. I would highly recommend this car."
This is our 4th Subaru and our favorite so far. We chose the Sport model of the Forester. We love the technology and all of the new safety features plus it's very comfortable getting in and out.
this car meet all my needs  Plenty headroom good visability very comfortable to drive. Plenty room for my grandsons and my grocery's   alot of room in backseat even for adults.
My wife is short and loves that the Forester sits high and with all the windows allows for good visibility. also is great in the snow.
This SUV meets our needs for comfort and also having AWD to get around in bad weather. Bought it to replace a 2001 Subaru that still has a lot of life left in it. These are great cars.
This is a perfect car for me.....roomy.......comfortable.....safe.....reliable....and great looking!  It is perfect for every day use and great for trips to see the grandchildren or just exploring.
This is my third Forester. They are comfortable and handle well; great for long trips or driving around town.  Lots of bells and whistles on this model. Techies will love it.
"I've only had it for over a week, but I am enjoying the heated steering wheel and the comfort PLUS the AWD. I'm impressed with the leg and head room as well."
Just bought the car today and I already know  I will have it for a long time! I love the ease of driving and the safety features
"Very reliable and comfortable car.
Interior style was most appealing.
Safety features were better than expected and we are confident driving this automobile.
Plan to purchase other Subaru's in the future."
This car has wonderful safety features and handles well in different weather conditions.  It's higher clearance is a plus in snowy mountain conditions.  I have owned a Subaru for 10 year and this one is even better than my last one.
"The 2021 forester is an amazing upgrade from the 2018 iI had, and I loved that one. The technology and safety features make it so much better"
"This is the third Subaru Forester that we have owned and we like this one most of all.  We like the comfort and styling, but most of all we like the safety features."
"Second Forester that I have owned. This is a great vehicle! Reliable, smooth ride, great gas mileage, nice looking, it is the complete package! Would recommend it highly!"
"Plenty of legroom, very comfortable for tall drivers and passengers. Lots of cargo room. Beautiful interior and paint. Lots of room. Definitely recommend this car!"
"We looked at many different types of cars and chose the Subaru Forester Touring for its reputation, reliability, durability, safety, comfort, value, options etc combined with the teamwork at Burke Motor Group in Cape May NJ! Our salesman was, JAMES HANNAN, who went above and beyond for us! From DOUGLAS BURKE; JAMES HANNAN, Sales Professional; JEREMY, GM; CHRIS, Finance; CONNOR, Service etc every question we had was answered and quickly! James and the Burke Team were wonderfully supportive and explained every detail thoroughly and the process was smooth and easy! We couldn't be happier with our 2021 Forester Touring and would HIGHLY recommend ""Subaru"" and ""The Burke Motor Group"" without reservation! 5 Stars ⭐"
"So far this SUV has all the interior accessories and accommodations needed. Love the headlights especially at night. This vehicle will center approximately and warn (blind sight area ) of on coming vehicles . Navigation/temperature control and so much more. So far, we love this vehicle."
This vehicle has exceeded all our expectations.  The interior is spacious and lots of room for people and cargo. The new Subaru platform creates a very comfortable and firm driving experience. MPG is great and the Sport trim level definitely draws attention. The safety features of the eyesight system have worked flawlessly so far and make driving much so much more enjoyable!
This car meets all of my needs with plenty of legroom and fine interior setting. Being AWD it really holds on to the road and makes driving a pleasure.The exterior design is beautiful and looks strong.
It’s a great car...the features are wonderful...I don’t want to drive anything but a Forester! It makes me feel safe and it’s very enjoyable to ride in.
I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Forester but the design and overall comfort was not to my liking. It feels like you are driving in a box which may be okay for some folks since the interior visibility in excellent because of the car shape. Otherwise the fit and finish of the car was above average and it seemed very steady on the highway. Road noise seemed pronounced to me in around town driving. Not for me but maybe a worthwhile car for some.
Purchased My third Subaru.  It is my comfort zone in vehicles. Very Reliable with good gas mileage.  Feel safe and especially like all the  safety features added.
"Comparing with my previous RAV4 (4 Toyotas since 1990) , I am surprised by my first Subaru which I just bought one month ago, 4x wheels in Base model, quiet (was noisy in RAV4), smart headlight system, smart cruise control....  etc. Of course, price is good :-)   It's much worth.   I am leaving Toyota"
"This car is comfortable ,has the safety features I need and drives like a luxury vehicle. My only complaint  is  that it does not provide a place for a woman's handbag. The seats can be adjusted to accommodate both my husband and me due to our large height difference."
This car has everything I needed.  It is AWD on all styles.  The Forester is extremely comfortable and spacious inside.  O’Leary of headroom and leg room.  The trunk space is also roomy for an SUV.  Great vehicle!!
"One smooth ride. Quiet. Great vision. Latest electronics, USB ports, etc. Lots of room. Looks great. The whole family enjoyed the ride and yours will too."
"This car has everything I was looking for when purchasing a new car. Thank you, Nicole, I am so glad that I purchased this car!"
"Upgrades are very reasonable and the safety features are amazing.  I will own this vehicle for a long time.   Did I mention comfort,  The best!"
Great fit and finish. Comfortable and spacious overall ride. Top safety rating according to NHTSA.  Completely satisfied. Consumer Reports rated the Forester top small SUV.
"This car met all my needs for safety. I am a nurse I work 60 hours a week, I finally feel safe driving home at night from work when I m tired."
So far it has met all my expectations.  Perfect size and very comfortable for my wife and myself.  Vehicle's performance has been great. My first experience with a Subaru auto.
"This car is exactly what we need for mountain and city driving and for long road trips. It performs well in snow and has incredible safety features (great for us older drivers). Wonderful sound system, beautiful ride!"
"I have been driving Subaru Foresters for both work and personal use since 1999.  These cars / SUVs are very reliable, and provide extra confidence and safety in challenging weather and road conditions."
"Perfect for our needs  with great visibility,  doors open wide allowing for easy entry and exit, very comfortable seats, and has top safety ratings for an SUV."
"The 2021 Forester easily meets our needs and is exceeding expectations.  We were looking for a smaller SUV, but with plenty of leg room and decent storage.  This car clearly delivers! Also, the safety features and upgraded features that are part of the Touring trim have been a nice add."
I love the forester. The car handles like a dream Fantastic in snow. So many safety features.  This is the first time I bought the same car twice.  All-American Subaru great dealership great personnel
"Versatile, safe, good driving, comfortable, great quality and  workmanship. Great car at a fair price.  We liked our first Forester so much we had to trade for another."
"I love the design-the reliability and gas mileage is awesome!!!
My sunroof is the bomb! The visibility and safety features are reassuring.
We own several Subaru’s."
"Just what we were looking for, both beautiful and safe. Love all the extra comfort features, plus the ones we expected, the safest car on the road."
"The car is well engineered and well thought out.   Too many wonderful features to describe here.  I would recommend test driving one, and seriously considering purchasing it."
"This 'non-luxury' car is way easier to drive than the luxury cars I test drove.  The car stops itself going forward and reverse, stays in its lane at speeds above 30 on cruise control, and matches the speed of the car infront of you.  I have never heard better stock sound coming out a new vehicle before; it blows HD Radio out of the water.  The ONLY negative is that you need to have the radio on or sun roof open because the engine is loud when accelerating."
The Forester Limited with all options is a great car from bumper to bumper.  No wonder it is the best selling model in the Subaru lineup.
This car meets all my needs. I used to own a low car and I recently bought a SUV. At first I was very intimidated to drive a SUV but this car is absolutely amazing. The settings of this car is incredible. It's not to big but not to small. The car is very spacious.
This is my second Forester.  Very roomy and great gas mileage!  Handles very well in rain and snow.  Would recommend to anyone looking for great gas mileage and a very comfortable ride.
"I fell in love with this car on the test drive. The ride is so smooth, the interior is comfortable and stylish. I love the safety features and the giant moon roof."
"Safety,  reliability, price, comfortable to drive. I am and will always be a Subaru owner. This vehicle is also pet friendly,  just made for us"
The 2021 Forrester Sport is a big improvement from the previous Forrester I drove. Like the new electronic offerings on this vehicle. Would definitely recommend this vehicle to others.
"The car is great for space, safe, great features, good on gas. It met all the needs I will use it for, skiing, traveling, back roads"
"Had the lane assist feature, check the back seat feature and steel rods in the back door panels which makes it possible  for a passenger to open the door even if door was smashed due to an accident."
"This car meets all my needs and from past experience I know how reliable and safe Subaru’s are.  Years ago my daughter was involved in a roll-over accident and were it not for the fact that she was in our Subaru, well she not be here today."
"My 2014 Forester met all my needs and I am certain my new Forester will do the same. Always reliable, comfortable and easy to drive."
Great ride and awesome visibility while driving.  The ride is so smooth and quiet compared to similar vehicles in this class.  It came down to the Honda CRV and the Forester and we feel we made the right choice!
"This car meets all my needs,. It is a safe and reliable car with great interior and exterior features and I am enjoying the smooth ride!"
"Just bought the 2021 Subaru Forester and picked it up last week. The salesman Nick was great to work with and when he wasn't available Nazar Martyniouk was right there to step in and help us to finalize the deal. The car came in earlier than expected and that made it even better.
    We went to pick it up and Nick explained how to work all the new gadgets in the car. Safety being number one, then fuel economy and lastly informational items were all explained very professionally. 
   Thank you Muller Subaru."
"This car meets our needs, The seats are comfortable. The ride is smooth and stable, The visibiiity is excellent and the safety features are reassuring"
