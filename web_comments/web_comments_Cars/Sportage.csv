"Would not lease another one. No spare tire- not even a donut.  
No jack. 
No automatic tailgate.  No way to pop tailgate from inside vehicle. Since it is important to me, I should have asked about tailgate, but no spare?
Brother supposed to get spiff for  referral.  6 months, nothing."
"It's a great car as long as you don't have any noises from motor after the first 500 miles and is getting  louder, the dealer won't replace any parts in question high pressure fuel pump follower, or a possible  timing chain tensioner.  Warranty department is yet to be desired on this issue but could just this kia dealer.  Love the kia sportage and  fun car to drive"
"The true litmus test will be on an upcoming 2 - month road trip, otherwise, I just have driven it much but so far I'm pleased"
"I love the sporty look. Every time that I look at it I can't believe it's mines. I wish it had automatic start and the trunk lift with the remote but I know I can't have everything. I love the drive modes the lane assist, cruise control, camera, sound of the music, the color, etc. Just overwhelmed and always looking forward to driving it again."
this car met all my needs with room and leg space along with the extra ubs cable hook ups i can also hook my phone and tablet to it
My kids (who are still in car seats) and I love it!  The space inside is very spacious and we feel fancy as my daughters said.  The panoramic sunroof really adds a great vibe. The pearl white is gorgeous.
"Drives well, smooth, and quiet. Has plenty of pep, just enough bells and whistles to make the drive enjoyable. Love the sporty look of the body style!"
"I got exactally what I asked for.  The car is perfect. Love the Pacific Blue. i 
Love the SX. Have owned Sportages for 25 Years. Never have I had an issue with them. None."
"Perfect for me, small, all wheel drive, and extra comforts, this is actually my second time purchasing a sportage and my third Kia. Reliable and good price"
This car was very dependable clean and sheep the moon roof was amazing üëèüèæ I would definitely buy this issue we but I would never purchase it from Casey kids go anywhere else just not to Casey key.
"Love the look,comfort...it's just a sharp and everything that you could want. I love the leather interior, the space and the ability to haul or for camping trips and you never know when you will have to go off road but at least you know that you can if needed!!"
It meets all my needs I love it. It rides great. Love the color. It gets great gas mileage. The salesperson that helped me was great.
This car has all I need with the exception that it doesn't have a CD player. Got it because I will need all wheel drive soon.
"Love everything about it. It's small enough so you don't feel like you're driving a tank but roomy enough to ensure everyone has a comfortable ride with plenty of room left over for all your stuff. The ride is extremely car is gorgeous inside and out, and the ride is incredibly smooth. The sound system is very important to me, and this one does not disappoint.  For the price, you cannot beat this vehicle."
"I really like the ""cockpit"" of the Sportage. Everything is at your fingertips and easy to see and read. It rides beautifully and looks great."
It was exactly what I was looking for in this size  suv nice features interior well made awd worked great in a 14 mile  trip in constant rain gas mileage could be better I got 27.5 from South Carolina to upstate New York less with awd I‚Äôd still buy this model again
"Perfect car, Plenty of room, excellent gas mileage, and tons of safety features.  Love the electronics that came with the car! You get a lot for your money with a KIA and a longer warranty than anyone else."
Comfort and style. My son who is six foot six fits comfortably and love the space he has.  Such a smooth ride and the seats are fantastic.  Love the back up camera!   Thank you Gary.
"This is my second Sportage. We love everything about it except the gas tank door. The old manual design was better. With this new automatic door, you have to remember to make sure it is closed 100%. If not, the mechanism does not pull it shut every time. Even my dealer doesn't like it."
"This car is great size for my son and I. Easy transition from a 2018 to a 2021. Rides great! Great interior, easy to use touch screen."
"The car has all the bells and whistles.  Except for the GPS in the dash, it is wonderful.  The problem with the GPS is YOU CAN'T SEE IT DURING THE DAY BECAUSE OF TO MUCH LIGHT coming through the windows: but, you can hear it. The other thing is you can open the back with remote but cannot close it except manually."
"Unbelievable car..... I love everything about it looks great and the functionality is endless, it's comfortable,  beautiful and quiet  drive,  love the uvo up...... its the best"
"I would highly recommend a visit to Seelye Kia if you are interested in a new or used car.  The staff was professional and educated on their product offerings.   The Kia Sportage S has all the options I was looking for, the Sports package is comfortable, stylish, and full of bells and whistles I did not have in my Toyota.  I could not be happier with my decision to purchase from Seely Kia in Kalamazoo and absolutely love my new Kia Sportage S."
"I downsized from a2018 Sorento LX and I like the Sportage S better. More comfortable seats, close to the same passenger space. Android auto works beautifully. 18 inch wheels make for a nice ride. Plenty of safety features... daytime running lights, blind spot monitor, along with a 5 star crash rating.  Black cherry with dark wheels looks great."
"Not only does this car meet my needs, but exceeds them in comfort, 'bells and whistles', gas mileage. What a GREAT vehicle. Just the right size, just the right pep, well - just the right everything!"
"Happy with my decision to purchase a Sportage. I like the safety features, the comfort, the ride. So far all good. I only have car a few days, I'll know more the more I drive it"
This car is the car i never see my self leaving. My Sportage Gets all the attention Rides and feels Great and is not the regular Honda and toyota you always see around i had a CR-V and i hated it i also drove a toyota  tucson worst mistake i ever did traded out of it in 2 years.
Very sharp looking.  All electronic features.  I don't like that there's no cd player in the vehicle since I own a big collection.  Color listed on reg was wrong.
"The car is great so far. My only concern is that it has less cargo room than my previous vehicle.
Comfortable to drive and looks great."
"I drive 70+ miles a day on highway. Safety in snow is amazing. Beautiful, sporty SUV, highly recommend. Tons of room for Family and luggage / groceries. Awesome warranty!"
"This is our 3rd Kia and it's been just as great as the last two. The quality and reliability are second to none. 
Highly recommend!"
"It's just what I needed comfort wise, dependability, looks.  I felt very safe when driving in this deep snow.  It took me right up the several steep hills that I must use to get into Mansfield."
"The. compact SUV Kia Sportage is so huge on performance, comfort and reliability to the point I had to purchase another one.This time I upgraded to an S to increase the comfort and overall driving experience as I drive for  a living.  With its V6 engine as opposed to a 4, you have a smooth ride, adjustable seats, seat warmers and fell like you are in a luxury SUV instead of a compact! It has 3 adjustable drive modes (I like the Sport mode option) My first Sportage had turned 10 years old and still going with nearly 250,000 mikes on it! So worth your investment! Go test drive one and you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"You feel like riding on a cloud.  If you get stuck in winter snows, this vehicle is wonderful in the snow and my kids love the reclining seats..."
I upgraded my car from a 2016 Soul to the 2021 SportageBest decision I made by getting this vehicle. No high pressure sales or hidden fees
So far so good.  Brand new owner less than a week and less than 100 miles driven so far but love the features (that I've figured out so far...need to work on studying the manual...lol)  Great double sunroof and navigation system.  Love the wireless charging pad too.  This KIA Sportage is a very fine vehicle!
Estamos muy contentos con nuestro nuevo veh√≠culo. Tiene todos los adelantos que nosotros est√°bamos buscando. Queremos recomendarlo a nuestras amistades. Era nuestro deseo de ser propietarios de un Kia.
This is the second Sportage we have owned.  The size is perfect.  Plenty of leg room.  Love the multi-purpose screen on the dashboard.  Has plenty of pick up and go.  Easy to maneuver.  Great car
Not worth the money I payed could of done much better elsewhere should of gone with the Chevy Equinox like I planned always go with your first choice
"Downsizing from older Sorento, this sportage is just the right size. Just as much legroom, spacious, better on gas, easier to park. Great family size vehicle."
"I just finished out my lease of a 2018 Sportage and leased a new 2021 Sportage. I absolutely LOVE this car! I especially like the look of the grill and rims on the newer model!!! It is a beast in the snow. I also love the new,  standard features like Android Auto!"
This car is comfortable. It has plenty of room.  The interior is beautifully designed. It has two USB ports. The dash is easy to learn.
"The vehicle definitely meets our needs for comfort, safety, and handling.  It has plenty of room for our family and we love the stylish looks.  This is the 3rd Kia we‚Äôve owned."
"this vehicle  fits all my needs. And I enjoy driving it! If you want a sporty car, but don't want to break the bank this car is for you."
"This is my third Sportage SX, never a problem, fun to drive, best value in the market. I love the performance, and like my first two SX's I know it will be trouble free."
I love my Kia Sportage.  It has great gas milage and is comfortable riding.  It has many safety features and a large back up camera screen.
So far I'm still learning about the beauty of my kia sportage. I'm excited about what I will discover it can do. And I'm looking forward to taking my lady on a ride.
"I love everything about it. I love the style and all the essentials that come with it. I just love it! Touchscreen radio, hands free phone calls and its all wheel drive which what I need, because of where I live. Need it for the snow."
The car suits me well. It‚Äôs comfortable and fits week in parking spots. It also drove great in the snow we had last week! So far I am very happy with this car.
"It is very nice comfortable and roomie
Like the color rides smooth , just your basic car nothing fancy  nice features
Gas is great I this car"
"I love the way this car responds. It‚Äôs roomy, it responds immediately and hugs the road. I love all the features and it‚Äôs super safe. The features like heated steering wheel and seats for winter and ac in the summer is great. Handles like a dream. Very responsive and reliable.  I can fit a ton of stuff in this car. It‚Äôs amazing. I just replaced my other Sportage with the newer model. Really good gas mileage, roomy and lumbar support makes long drives a piece of cake."
Met all of my needs and drives like a dream.  It is smooth driving down the road.  Love the navigation system and the radio.  It os wonderful.
This purchase was perfect size for me and my 2 kids!!!! I see a lot of road trips in the near future! Thanks for making a great vehicle!
My car is fully loaded and it is beautiful (and RED!). It is very comfortable and drives very nicely.  It was hard to say good-bye to my 2012 Kia Sportage but this one is amazing.
"This is a beautiful, well performing, comfortable,dependable vehicle. Best one so far!! Very roomy interior. Beautiful outside color and interior. My second Sportage and I absolutely love it!"
It is an excellent vehicle.  Love the style and over all performance.  It handles great with all the safety features as well.   Love the color.
"Lots of room..... the style is amazing, inside and out, and it handles very well on the road..... would recommend a Sportage to anyone..... Especially an EX !!!"
"Love my new Sportage Turbo, has all the bells and whistles on it.  It almost seems to drive itself. Love the guys at the Kia dealership, thanks for all the help over the years."
"This vehicle is quite comfortable and drives so smoothly and responsively.  The interior is very roomy but still has the feel of a snug sports car. I couldn't be more pleased with the feel, the handling and especially the looks. The Nightfall package is really sharp and I've noticed several years turning as I drive past.  I couldn't be more pleased."
