Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"(1/27/22 UPDATE: Living in the Northeast, we get all the wonderful elements. Safety features decided to disable themselves.  Took it down to Nissan, and the tech guy said that there is nothing they can do because Nissan developers are (his words) fucking morons for putting the sensors directly underneath the bumper. So when water, mud, snow hit it, it disables. So I said your telling me that I have safety features that are supposed to protect me and my family in the elements, but the elements prevent the safety features from working! And he said ""that is exactly what I am telling you"".) ORIGINAL POST: I have had my 2021 Nissan Rogue SV Premium Edition for 2 months now. More than half the time it has been in the shop. CVT issues strike again! 2300 miles and the SUV buckles when merging onto the highway, RPMs shoot up to 5-7 when the vehicle is at 15 mph preventing it to accelerate. If it wasn't for the quick instincts of the driver coming at me, I would have been in a horrific accident due to no acceleration coming out of a side street. This vehicle has been nothing but problematic since purchasing, which is really too bad."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"Fell in love and traded in my 2017.  This is my third Rogue and after my 2017 i was convinced never again... but I did and now regret! A couple of months ago when it was extreme cold temperatures my 2021 wouldn’t start. Would turn over but engine wouldn’t engage... first time this happened thought it was my fault cause foot slipped off break while pressing the push button start.  Waited 15 min, attempted again and it started.   A couple weeks later, happened again.  Only parked for approximately an hour, this time my foot was firmly on brake and no start!   Tried to boost, waited it out and nothing.  With only 500 km , I decided to have towed back to dealership!  Unacceptable!!! Computer scans and error after error appeared.  Now the reports are with the Nissan engineering for review and conclusion for fix. The 2021 rogue has proven to have issues with start when temperatures is -15 C and colder!  The reading suggest replace computer but results are still under review.  I have issued complaint with NIssan Canada... still waiting for conclusion.   Very concerning cause I travel daily in rural communities and winter is 6 months long with daily normal temperatures of -15 for at least 3-4 months. Caution if you live in colder climates!!!  Want to give 5 star for the mere beautiful change inside and out, the ride is amazing but the starting issue drops the rating to only 2 stars:("
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I just purchased a brand new rogue 7 days ago and yesterday I took it to the freeway to test the propilot and after 5 minutes the warning light was on and said CVT malfunction Service not available. I pulled off to a stop turned off the engine and restart again. The warning light was gone. I got back to the freeway again and turned the autopilot again and about 3 minutes warning light on again. I can't turned it off so had pulled over and stopped the engine and restart again this time the CVT malfunction light was gone but engine check light was on and can't turned it off. I called the dealer and dropped the car off for them to fix it. It was frustrated when you spent over $32k for a brand new car and only last for 120 miles and had to go to the shop. Never experience anything like this before on a new car. Very disappointed, should have gone for a different brand."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,Do not buy. 2021 Nissan Rogue 23 hours old and 170.0 miles suffered catastrophic engine failure. Worst part is that Nissan left my parents who are in their 80’s on the side of the freeway in the middle of nowhere and car can’t charge phone and it’s cold and raining with semi trucks passing them and hazard lights will not work. Nissan says we are sending a truck but we are going to leave you on the side of the road and you need to call Uber or negotiate with the tow company. Nissan’s response put their lives in danger for over 4 hours. My mom and dad are terrified of this car and Nissan’s response.... I will bet everything I own that Honda or Toyota’s response would have been way better and It’s not possible to be any worse...
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"According to my technician at Summerlin Nissan in Ft. Myers, FL...the possible malfunctions ""may be taken care of with the two recalls we have on your vehicle.""  My reply:  What recalls?

Antilock breaking software issues was the recall they have allegedly resolved.  After 5 hours of sitting in a waiting room.

Next issue:  Constantly being told I need an oil change.  Service light comes on with the little oil can.  Its so cute.  (Sarcasm).  Started when I first had 350 miles on the car.  Took it in.  It is properly set in the dashboard of the car, but there is something else malfunctioning causing this to again, malfunction.

Next issue:  Sonar Lane Change Blind Spot Detection shuts off at will.  No reason.  

Next Issue:  While sitting in the parking lot of a grocery store, every warning light came on in my car.  Tech told me to wipe off the sensor.  Um, which sensor and where is it located and why, after just over 1000 miles should I have to be doing this in the first place.

Called Nissan USA directly.  They told me a whole different story aside from what the service techs and manager told me.  They claim to have told them that I refused to leave the vehicle for service.  In a manner of speaking.  After waiting over 4 hours for what was supposed to have been an appointment, I had no more time and they had no loaner.  So, yes, I did refuse, but I have the text trail to prove the actual comments and the photos sent to the techs of all these screw ups.  Awaiting to hear from Nissan to see if they are going to buy this piece of tin back from me.  My first, and certainly my last, Nissan.

Top of the line....if this is as good as it gets, I feel sorry for Nissan."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"My daughter bought this 2021 Nisson Rogue, piece of junk. It has 1900 miles on it and it is in the shop for the second time, should of been 3rd.  Imagine driving down the interstate, engine failure coming across the dash, the car pulling itself over to the side of the road and putting itself in park, scarey huh. And Nissan's solution, don't replace the car, oh no, it needs a module that they have no idea when it will be available and whether it will even fix the problem.  I drive a Toyota and would never even consider a Nisson, especially after this."
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,"I recently upgraded my 2018 Rogue SV for a Rogue SV 2021. I love the new exterior design, and new safety technology. However, I failed to review the new Rogue SV features before I went to a dealership. The sales guy focused on showing me the new features and never mentioned what was taken away from the 2018 SV nor I asked for it. Now I am very disappointed that my 2018 SV had more convenient features than my 2021 SV and yet I paid more for the 2021 car. Rogue SV 2021 doesn't include:
 
Motion-Activated Liftgate -kick sensor
Power liftgate- Keyfob-opening & closing 
Blind spot sensor (alarm sound is very low)
power heated front seats
Divide-N-Hide and multi-level Cargo System
Power height-adjustable liftgate 

After this rip-off, I will think it twice before I lease another  car from Nissan again. They overpriced the New Rogue SV, and if you want the old standard SV features, you would have to go for the SL trim and of course pay at least $5000 or more than an SV."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Update!

Buyer beware. I’ve had a draining battery that needed charging. AC very lacking for a new car. Leaking drain or roof racks. Rattling in car. Nothing can ever verified or fixed. Light always coming on saying I need an oil change. Which started at 12 miles. It’s been reset more times then I can count.  But the newest problem is which first happened June 3rd and again on July 13th engine malfunction reduced power. You can’t accelerate more then 40 mph. Being told the code is gone. Seriously anyone can clear a code. The code scanned by dealership as EGR. I’m finding out this is an issue from other blocks. I can’t recommend this car at all any longer. I’m afraid of the safety concerns to my family in this car. 

The Rouge Platinum has all the safety and comfort I was looking for. I love almost everything about the car. It’s a pleasure to drive. Only drawbacks is no ventilation in seats, no height adjustment in passenger seat, no auto up and down on passenger side.These are big deals.  I love the wireless charger and wireless Apple Car Play. Digital display is beautiful and crisp and can be customized on the platinum. I’ve got many compliments on the car."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,I just bought this car and have had it for 32 days and the computer is making the service light come on. I just took it to the dealer and they said the entire computer needs to be changed and is why the check engine light keeps turning back on.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,From day 1 i have issues with this 2021 nissan rogue sv   I cnstantly get engine lite on the car dont start it says i need the key  the key is sitting next to start button also get locked in or out    Very dissapointed to say the least i have medical issues that keep me from walking or standing to much im actually afraid to take this car anywhere due to that and more dealership has been great i find nissan higher ups to be issue the car was looked at 10 times new battery put in at 400 miles car will not charge past 70 percent car was looked at last week by their higher up tech he coudnt duplicate issue of no start and lockiut so they are closing the case out >>>if i have anymore issues feel free to call hello the issues never stopped..such a waste of money I should have kept my tblazer..
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I am with great disgust writing this review hoping that Nissan Canada finally does something about the defective Rogue 2021 cars.  Took a brand new Nissan out of the showroom and it malfunctioned . Called them they said bring it in and a part was ordered after 4 weeks. Took it in for inspection and replacement . I took it out again after 30 minutes while changing lanes my malfunction light went on . 
If I got into an accident while using the technology they sold me and persuaded me to get platinum , would they be responsible .
I don’t feel safe in this car , I’m paying through my nose for what piece of failed machinery . Nissan better recall the cars before something terrible happens. They just do blame game shifting responsibility between the dealership and other factors . Nissan horrible service , total disaster ,no responsibility , what kind of company is this . 
They have had multiple complaints and are still selling this dysfunctional car knowing malfunction can be hazardous to be on the road . Shame on you Nissan , entrapping  us in a lease and selling us such a car knowing it has issues abs then not recalling them nor replacing them nor cancelling our lease . 
I hope you read this and take some damn action !!!!!"
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,"Bought new 2021 Nissan Rogue SV in June 2021. Decision was based on the beautiful exterior/interior design, features available at an affordable price compared to the other brands. Within first two months, the infotainment touch screen stopped working multiple times and would start working again after the vehicle was restarted, loud noise from engine or transmission while driving on the freeway. After the vehicle was restarted that noise is now gone. I am now really skeptical as to what will go wrong next. I am loosing my confidence on the Rogue if it will serve as a reliable vehicle for my family."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Problem with the AC, the temperature cannot be controlled, it comes out hot from the driver's fans and I took it to the dealer and they told me that it was designed to work that way, which is normal, it drives me crazy. I've tried to get the problem solved but until now they say it's normal and bought a dozen new cars and it's the first time this has happened to me with a 42-mile car"
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,right away it had transmission issues. Would not accelerate correctly at times. Happened at least five times in three months… not sure why. The RPMs shoot up and the car won’t accelerate properly. Have to turn it off and back on again and then it works. Took it in for that and the recall on the reprogramming of the ABS (got that letter days after my purchase). They did a thorough check on the car and it also needed a new battery!!! Battery was low. What?!! 2021 was a redesign… don’t buy Nissans when they do a redesign. Wait at least a year til they iron out the kinks.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I leased my 2021 Nissan Rogue AWD Premium package Feb 2, 2021 and I regret it. I have 800 miles on it, live in Ohio and the temperatures can get very cold. The remote starter is a piece of crap. It won't work until you get all the way up to vehicle. The Nissan Connect to start the vehicle isn't that great either.Thank goodness its a trial. I owned a 2018 Rouge, took it in two times out of the 31 months I owned it for issues. 

With this 2021 my first incident happened when we got extremely cold temps and snow a week of me owning. The window and windshield wipers iced up so bad I could barely see. When sitting at a light the engine will idle very high and when I pull off, you would think I'm drag racing. As my foot is on the gas pedal you can feel the vehicle decelerating instead of accelerating. A warning light had popped on and off quickly. When I took it to the dealer they asked me did a warning light come on? I said yes but it quickly went away. They seen an old code but nothing to document. Said it was low voltage light and that's probably why I feel the decelerating as its trying to pull power. Then preceded to say unfortunately Nissan's don't like the cold and not built for it. Are you kidding me!!! I've also owned a 2016 Altima and the 2018 Rogue and never had that issue.

The traction control (VDC)  is kicking on every time I go over this rail road track that's on a slight incline once I'm over it I can not accelerate because of the VDC. and it's happening when the weather is nice and the roads are not wet. This is a dangerous situation as other cars could be behind me trying to get over track before a train comes. The radio is giving me problems. As of today was playing music, received a phone call answered and the music would not play again. Could change stations, but not hear anything. After 4 minutes received another phone call, caller was very low after hanging up the music started playing again. This is my only means of transportation. This will be my last Nissan. These 3 years are going to be so long. Wish I could get out of it now. However, I don't have 15- 17K just sitting around to put with a another vehicle to eat up the negative equity.   

Update 10-8-21
Still having issues. You can feel every bump in the road. The dash on driver’s side started lifting. On the passenger side some of the panels is separating. When panoramic sunroof cover is open and you have the windows down you hear the cover flapping. 
Started hearing front end noise. The list is too long. Nice redesign. But I had enough that I was blessed to get out of it on yesterday."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,I had a 2018 Rogue for three years and never had to do any service to it besides oil. I just got my 2021. This is my 25 day having it and it again has to be serviced. First time my low engine malfunction came on and apparently there will be a recall for it soon. Now my remote start doesn't work and its -33 windchill right now.  Super disappointed since I loved my old rogue. Need some reliability.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"We leased a 2018 SV Rouge.  The lease was up and went to Gerald Nissan in Naperville to see our long time sales consultant Howard Krick.  At first we were not interested in the new Rouge.  The 2018 was a bit sluggish and the CVT was loud and didn't have a punch.  I already lease a Murano and we were prepared to purchase one...Then Howard suggested my Wife drive the 2021 Rouge just to see.......WOW!  what an improvement.  From a quiet ride, to a higher stance, a good punch with the increased horse power.  The interior is top notch.  We leased the SL with the premium package....it has almost everything you need.  Check it out....it's worth a test drive.  If this is any indication of what the 2022 Pathfinder will be, then I may lease one of those, when my lease if up in November.  I have owned 7 Nissan's and these cars just get better and better....."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"Complaint,  why didnt Nissan but a garage door opener on the rearview mirror? I bought a 2021 Nissan rogue sl, I had a 2018 sl that had it on ."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"I have been car shopping for some time now,  I decided to check out the Rouge platinum and it was incredible! Quiet ride, panoramic roof plus all other bells and whistles.  It lacks power when accelerating, but it's a great family SUV!"
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"2021 Nissan Rogue SV is junk.  Has been in the shop 3x before even putting on 5,000 miles.  Recalls, air conditioner did not work and now waiting  to get a new radio and screen ordered as this stopped working too. This vehicle is a very rough ride and noisy. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  I contacted Nissan and was told there is nothing they can do!  They will not give me my money back or give me the value of the Rogue in trade.  I will be trading in for anything but a Nissan - at a huge loss!"
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"Engine idles like a train, passenger seat shaking up due to bad idling, transmission rebuilt soon and snow enters air duct and will jammed pack the filter, your max speed becomes 10 miles an hour"
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"Our 2021 Rogue platinum is beautiful, comfortable to drive, and loaded with amazing features. The manual is an inch thick and it took us 2 weeks to get a basic understanding of the various gadgets.  With all these advanced digital features, wouldn't you think Nissan would have thought to include a built in garage door opener??? We have our 15 year old, clunky garage door opener attached to the nice and clean sun visor on the driver's side of our gorgeous new car.  What's up with that???  This car has everything - well almost. The 10 year old car we traded in for this new beauty had a built in garage door opener. Nissan what were you thinking?"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable. The Platinum is loaded. Lots of cargo space. Good mileage.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,I just made my first payment with 2600 miles. The chip engine light came on after 6 days. Service says they don’t have a fix yet. My remote start won’t work and my Nissan app says my rogue is running when it is parked beside my house. I’m looking at it right now. Run.. don’t walk!!!
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"CONS
Major:
#1 - I purchased the top of the line package out the door at $42K, and dont get a Homelink?  
#2 - The horn is LOW. Nobody can hear us.  Had to get this replaced.
#3 - The shifters have changed where its (R-N-D) instead of (D-N-R).  That's right, there are going to be accidents for sure.  I thought I could get used to this, but I pause and do a lot thinking before I move the vehicle since my wife and I share 2 vehicles with the shifters backward.

Definitely dont understand #1, #2 #3.  Engineers must have been drunk when they finalized this.  

Annoying
#4 You will feel the road.  Noisy.  I guess its a trade off if you want to get more MPG.
#5 Tires will skid in heavy rain at 50mph on highway.  We were on a 80mph highway, went 50, and started to skid.  Car didnt feel sturdy.  Had to reduce to 30 mph.  This is less performant than my Murano.  I will change the tires after a couple of years to top of the line.
#6 Very expensive!  We paid MSRP and the dealer squeezed us an extra 2K out of us for this stupid dealer package because new cars are in high demand due to chip shortage.  Looking back, we should have went to another dealer.  But at 42K, this is way over priced for what we are getting.  I will say the 0% financing did save us a little.
#7 Navigation is incorrect at times, even the MPH, which the adaptive cruise control is based on.  Sometimes the adaptive cruise goes too fast or accelerates too fast.  Not always accurate, have to pay attention.

PROS
- Saves a lot of gas, good for local work commute.
- Love the new electronics, heads up display, steering assist and all that jazz.  It is very nice.  I think every automaker top of the line will have these.
- Seats pull back when you turn off the engine, lets you get out easier.
- Safety features
- Size good enough for my family of 4.
- Even though twice as expensive as my last car, it was actually $300 a year to insure it.  Nice surprise! I guess insurance considers all the extra safety features.

WOULD I BUY IT AGAIN?
I dont know, but I would have most likely gotten the Mazda CX5 Signature."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I leased a 2021 Nissan Rogue SV and less than 24 hours after I drove it out of the dealership, a warning ⚠️ appeared ""Engin Malfunction, Reduced Power, Service Now"". Went to the dealership the next day and received BS answers one after the other. The warning has come up 7 timed in the 5 months I have had it and I have taken the car in twice now and left it so they can figure out why the warning comes on. The first time for 3 weeks and the second time for 7 weeks. To this day, they have no solution, they don't know why it happens yet they say the car is safe to drive and they release it back to me. The Willowdale Nissan Manager (Jino Park) and Salesperson (Roger Peng) ignored my emails. The Service department said there's nothing they can do and the customer satisfaction managers also care more about their own pockets than making customers happy. The issue is still not fixed and I have to continue paying for this car until the end of my lease in 3 years, which to me feels like I'm flushing my money down the toilet every month!!! Nissan doesn't care at all about customers and their car buying experience! This has been a nightmare and the worst car-buying experience I have ever had! Never Again!!! Buy anything but Nissan!!!"
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Do.not.buy.a.2021.Nissan.Rogue! I bought my Rogue last year and it’s been in the shop more times than I can count. I’ve had engine issues, battery issues, passenger seat issues, multiple water leak issues and I only have 5k miles ( mostly because it’s always in the shop! ) I filed a complaint with Nissan and requested a buy back but was denied. While the service department that works on my vehicle is nice and helpful it’s just a crappy car and I regret purchasing it."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"I am driving a 2018 Honda CR-V. Love it. However, it's my 2nd one. I drove a few different like vehicles and i must say other than the Mazda CX5, the Rogue was impressive. The interior in my opinion was the nicest of the bunch. Nissan did a great job. I thought it rode well and the engine power was adequate I personally felt it needed more power but for most people it is just fine. The interior makes you feel like you are in a much more expensive car. There are a few things about it that I absolutely did not like. The center console storage is a split opening like a clam shell. I hated that. I keep a lot of stuff in mine and this would drive me crazy. The opening is narrow and small making it hard to get your hand in there. The salesman said but you have a shelf underneath, well try to access that while you are driving, NOT HAPPENING. I personally do not like the side mirrors as they are angled in a funny position. These are minor things but I personally think that Nissan has a huge winner on their hands. The Rogue is one of the best looking compact SUV on the road today and i think the interior is nicer than the Mazda CX5. I think the Mazda handles the best and doesn't feel like an SUV drives like a sports car. I am probably alone in my thoughts but i do not like the Mazda knob to control the radio, HVAC and driver info center. ""IT'S DISTRACTING"" The Rogue has a ton of tech and is not annoying like the Mazda. That being said, I really like the Rogue until I got back in my 2018 Honda CR-V and drove it home. My Honda has a better ride and has better pickup on the highway. Also i like the fact that everything in my Honda is easy to see and I am not over whelmed by too many buttons and screens. But i am 63 years old and most people would consider me old but i am very tech savvy and for me, less is better inside a car. Too many distractions are a bad thing today when it comes to driving. If i did not have a Honda I probably would have bought the Rogue immediately. Great vehicle."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"I am so pleased with my new car! Everything from the Interior, the performance & looks of this car gets a 10/10 from me. Definitely my favorite car i've ever owned so far. Thank you Steven Wilson from the Fontana Nissan dealership for helping me with my purchase, I couldn't be happier."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"I have a platinum. The car is gorgeous and there are so many convenience & safety upgrades. However, 6 months after purchasing I noticed water damage on the ceiling. The passenger side pillar is leaking. It’s been in the shop for 6 weeks with no end in sight, as they can’t get the parts to repair it. I have read a Reddit thread and cars continue to leak after the “repair,” as they’re just replacing with the another shoddy part. This is the only affordable SUV I love and I am terribly disappointed. My 2017 rogue SL was wonderful."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Less than 500 miles and in the shop exactly half the time I have owned it.
Electrical issues. Shuts it's self down."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"The seat is so uncomfortable. There is no proper lumbar support and all the support feels way low on the back, almost at hips. Starts to hurt my back in 15-20 minutes. I haven't had any back issues with any cars at all. No issues even with older rogues.

Every little bump or uneven road surface feels so loud and jerky. Really poor suspension. Air conditioning ducts don't work properly. One will blow hot air and others will blow cold air. 

Bought this for comfort but there is no comfort for me."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"This is an initial review. We bought a Boulder grey pearl 21 SL. We’ve had it for a week now. My wife loves this vehicle. It is very easy to drive, so easy, that if you turn on the pro pilot cruise it will literally drive itself. The shifter is different but only took a trip or two to get used to it.  The seats are very comfortable, it’s the most comfortable vehicle I have ever sat in. The tech is crazy good in this car and easy to understand. Nissan made it very user friendly. The features are amazing in the SL. The motion lift gate works perfectly. The storage space in the rear is comparable to our old Honda Element (with the rear seats removed) which is a huge positive. My wife does animal rescue and loves how easy it is to put cages and supplies in back. I took it grocery shopping and the divider system in rear was perfect for groceries, no sliding around issues. The rear seat is big. I’m 5’10 and our sales guy was 6’6. He was easily able to ride in the back seat behind me with plenty of knee room. The ride quality is smooth, very smooth. Like every Nissan, the engine is perky. One thing my wife loves about my 2011 Nissan Frontier is how much punch the engine has and this 4 banger Rogue doesn’t disappoint. Sport mode allows a little more punch from the engine and you can feel it in traffic. I have yet to have to refill the tank. So far, we’re averaging 34 mpg and that’s about 60% rural and 40% city driving, so impressive is a understatement. The vehicle has a massive panoramic sunroof so the interior feels huge compared to other SUVs. The information center on the car is big and easy to access. We have been using it with AppleCar play and it’s worked fine every time. The hands free options for texting or calling work great. The interior of the vehicle is not just functional, it’s a gorgeously detailed interior. Dual colors for the dash and door material. The wood grain accents really sell luxury and all the material seems very high quality especially compared to previous Nissans such as the old rogue or my old frontier. The road noise is low and I do not hear any whining from the CVT. The LED lights make a huge difference at night which my wife loves since we have to spend sometime avoiding deer and black bears on the roadways. Overall, this vehicle is exceptional."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"We just bought this today and it was 2 hours home. In the city of Bangor Maine the roads are smooth so the ride is ok. As we got outside of Bangor this thing rides like a tank, you feel every single bump hard. There is no comfort mode on this car. The seat are terrible and to make it worse any bump on one side and the body roll on this thing is unreal. We won't be keeping this. It is too bad because it is a sharp vehicle but the hard ride and seats and body roll make this one to stay away from. Worst car we have ever bought,"
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Had a corrupted file fry my anitlock brake software on the first oil change. At 15,000 miles my tires need replaced. Stay away from this vehicle. Nissan did compensate for the software issue but will not stand by the tires they are putting on new vehicles."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Awesome car. Love the style. Spacious and comfortable.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,I love the new body style and interior of the 2021 Rogue. It was a great first impression to the car and only got better with the exceptionally smooth drive that followed. The safety driving features are amazing and the update technology works amazingly.  Purchasing the 2021 Nissan Rogue was the best decision that I could make.
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded a 2018 Nissan Rogue to this 2021 Rogue; I’ve owned this vehicle for almost 3 months now and as of now I’ve sat in the waiting room for three and a half hours due to recalls and my engine light being on this fast week only foe it to be 3 days later and my engine light is on once again. Stopped at O’Reillys on the way home and was told after plugging it up that it is in fact on again due to the fuel rail. I’ve never had this many issues, this vehicles came with lots of flaws"
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my new 2021 Rogue from Walt Massey Nissan in Andalusia, Al. several months ago. Several weeks after buying it my wife and I traveled to another State via Interstate Highway to visit our son. We discovered that when you drive the vehicle over 45 mph, or a road with expansion joints the Sideview mirror on the drivers side vibrates so much you can't distinguish objects coming up behind and beside you. When we returned home I took the vehicle back to the selling dealer. The mechanic that serviced the Rogue reported that he ""even drove a Rogue out of the dealers inventory and it had the same situation so there is nothing wrong with it"". I called Nissan of North America and was told to take it to another Nissan dealer, a trip of over 100 miles from Andalusia. The reason I chose Walt Massey Nissan was to where I could have any service, if needed, done locally; I am now wondering if I chose the wrong make of vehicle or just the wrong dealer?"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"To be honest, I hadn't thought much about the Rogue. I had the impression that it was lame, weak, boring and not very capable. After researching some competitors, I researched the Rogue to be thorough. It met my basic requirements - AWD, over 8"" ground clearance, at least decent gas mileage, good cargo space, creature comforts like Android Auto. It seemed worth looking at in person. When I test drove it, I was pleasantly surprised. It handled very well for a CUV. I really like the cabin design/layout. The seats are very comfy. It has tons of safety features. I hope it does as well in the snow as advertised!"
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I have had the car a little less than a week. I've been around cars all my life. Right now we have an '18 Porsche 911 we use on weekends and a '21 Lexus RX350 my girlfriend drives. This car replaced a '19 Jeep Grand Cherokee as I wanted to downsize a little.
I considered the Subaru Outback, Volvo XC60 and looked at Hondas as well as another Grand Cherokee if all else fails. As most are aware, it is very difficult even finding inventory and then when you find a car in stock it never has the trim level you want.
Overall I am happy with the Rogue but the quality control at the Tennessee plant stinks. After bringing the Rogue home I noticed two things immediately. 
1) There is a gap with the rear hatch closed. Very uncommon to see issues like this today.
2) The passenger side front and rear doors were NEVER finished at the factory. It looks like a teenager in shop class for the first day finished them. The door skins came off the cutter and then wrap around the inside of the door top and bottom. On this car you can see where the metal came off the cutter and it looks like a piece of aluminum foil you cut from a roll. It is then supposed to be filled in and painted. It never was. The driver's side is fine. The passenger side just had some paint slapped on it. How does a car leave the plant with these glaring issues?
I hold the plant manager responsible and the QC team. Just shoddy workmanship. Period.
The car rides OK but it is a stiff ride with the 19"" wheels/tires. You will feel every imperfection in the road. And be aware of the tire pressure. 33 front, 30 rear.
Wind noise is noticeable even at lower speeds.
You have to go up to the Platinum model to get side sensors which we had on the Jeep. I did not want the Platinum model because I don't want ""quilted"" seats.
As noted by reviewers online the Bose sound system is really subpar. You hear the small left and right side pillar speakers and that's about it. It may well be the worst sound system I have heard in many years. And who puts a subwoofer next to the spare tire well and then covers it? Ridiculous.
Having only a few hundred miles on it I hope I don't run into some of the issues I have read here in the reviews. Subaru, Honda and others are using the CVT transmissions so one would think they are sorted out. 
One a positive note I will say that there is a nice paint job on it and with the exception of what I noted above the build quality is good. That may sound like an oxymoron but the defects are quite noticeable. It also does not have an AGM battery. If you have a car with Auto start/stop you have an AGM battery. I know. Jeep replaced THREE of them in a TWO year period. Not only are they expensive but they require a technician to calibrate everything when it's installed. About $235+ for the battery and $125+ for labor/calibration. Fair warning, DON""T get a car with the Auto Start/Stop if you plan on keeping it past the warranty period. Even if they cover the battery, they DON""T cover the calibration. 
The a/c takes a little while to get cold and the engine takes a little longer to come up to temp than I am accustomed to but both are livable. 
I have read the reviews here as well as owners' reviews on other brands. Every brand/model has their good and bad points. 
The bottom line is;
Would I get another Nissan? 
I will say I regret not waiting a few more months as Jeep and some other brands of interest are coming out with all new models."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,Engine is anemic even in sport mode. The sun roof is a joke. Hardly opens enough to do anything. Seats aren't that comfortable. The center console does not move so you can't get support under you're right arm if you need it. Cabin is quiet and feels sturdy. Definitely an improvement in cabin design and looks.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Bought 2021 rogue only in May 2021. With only less than 1k miles, my car started to experience acceleration problems where you can go any faster than 40mph while RPM shoots up to 5-7. I recorded 2 incidents and showed to Nissan but all they say they found no code! This is really a threat to our safety and Nissan keeps on ignoring the issues. They don’t give a damn"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Well I haven’t purchased the rogue yet but I do test drive it ! My husband and I test drove a Kia Sorento it was nice . We are trying to really take time and make sure we get one that’s right for the family he has a new Chevy truck! So we decided to test a few out that rated well ! So we had to drive to Jamestown NY. Since there’s no Nissan dealer near us in Pennsylvania! There’s one in Hornel NY. But we decided to go to Jamestown those two were the closest. Well we loved the Rogue everything about it ! The looks and the feel . Room is spacious! I’m surprised the one guy wrote he was 6 ft 1 talk and 240 lbs and was cramped because I’ve watched you tube videos on it and the one guy was 6 ft 1 or 2 and he said he was around 240 or 250 those were his words in the video he fit just fine with plenty of room he did adjust the steering wheel so it came out more ! But I know some people say it’s not speedy but I found it fun to me and my husband it’s beautiful that’s for sure and very solid ! I already have everything picked out for it once we test drive a few more ! To see  Honda we haven’t yet or Toyota  and Hyundai ! That will be it !! But I did look them all up and the Nissan looks so much better but my husband said I just can’t go by looks well I said you can by comfort cuz I honestly don’t know how the others are going to beat the rogue on that !!! A+++++!! Great job Nissan !
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"So far I'm super impressed with the vehicle.  Very comfortable inside and all the tech one can need.  That heads up display is fantastic! Enough engine power for most drivers. 
Only quirky thing I've noticed is the wireless phone charger.  My iPhone 12 Pro Max fits nicely but often takes a few times repositioning it to get it to connect and charge.  I've not tried a smaller phone yet but will.  
Overall I'm very happy and impressed with this Rogue!"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Platinum trim is awesome.  Quiet, smooth ride.  Could not be happier.  Traded my 2015 Murano SL and I'd have to say the new Rogue seats are just as comfortable and the Rogue; Platinum has less road noise."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,The 4 cylinder engine is a loud irritating  constant humming or buzzing sound.  Even turning the radio up loud does not help.  Not an enjoyable experience.   I dread having to take it on a 9 hour road trip!
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t be happier with this purchase.  Affordable and smooth ride.  Extremely spacious and will love driving to and from work in this.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,The Rouge Platinum edition has all the bells and whistles tech lover can have. Looks at all the editions and make the best decision for you.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this car! I used to hate any car to longer than 3 hours. No more! Drives like a dream and fantastic gas mileage. Love the Bose sound system that came with the premium package  and the super comfortable leather seats. It’s got great pick up for a 4 cylinder and we are definitely happy with the purchase. I highly recommend!
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,The reviews don’t lie. The new Rogue is exemplary. The ride and handling exceed that of the three letter German SUV. Gas mileage is over 30 MPG. QUIET too.
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,"I have a 2021 nissan rogue sport s for approximately 10 months now. I am being flashed every where I go night and day because my DRL is constantly bright and even though they dim once the headlights turn on, it doesn't help matters since even on low beam the lights seem to be always so bright. I have been back to the dealer and I guess because I am a woman, I am being told there is nothing they can do without them even getting a technician to check. I am beyond frustrated. Feels like I have been  bamboozled!!!"
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Cruise hasn’t worked since day 1. Front panel goes black for 20-30 minutes before gradually returning to normal. Warning senors never work.
Lights won’t automatically go from brights to dim."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I had this car for a month already , it is very quiet and it feel luxurious,  save gas, BOSE audio is really good and the infotainment is good but it had crashed twice already ,probably  it will be solved with updates , overall I am very pleased 😀with car 🚗."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"We love our Nissan vehicles, this 2021 Rogue SL with Premium Package brings up to date.  Meine Frau and I were considering a second Murano then announced she wanted much better gas mileage, thus the “Rogue Idea” was born.  Found our Rogue through Edmunds, went to Courtesy Nissan Tampa for “a look” and transacted business.  Our salesman was tops in our book-Ben Walker.  Our Rogue is, being updated and completely transformed for the 2021 model year, is simply no longer the “mouse-car” Rogue of old!  The 4 cylinders sirprised is with PLENTY of pep and acceleration.  I could go on and on, but will just say this:  the 2021 Rogue is an exceptional auto and buy.....per us, Nissan has hit a home run with this NEW Rogue. (Over the years....three Nissan trucks-2 being kingcabs, 1 Maxima, 1 Altima, 1 Murano)  Repeat after me: N i s s a n.  Good, you’ve got it!  Smile."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"Peppy with a nice ride.  Jam packed with tech, but not as much as the 2019 jeep Cherokee I traded in.  Actually the only thing I miss is the searchable owners manual that can be bought up on the screen.  I like the size, storage and kick to open tailgate.  The seats are comfortable and sidelines are not obstructed.  Very pleased with the vehicle. One exception.  The electric shifter is hard to get used to and probably dangerous.  To shift into reverse the shifter has to be gripped while depressing a button on the side. Easy.  Then to move in reverse the shifter to be moved forward.  If you operate it like any other  car in the world and move it backwards,  add some gas a d the vehicle will move forward.  Very hard to get used to.  Otherwise love the vehicle.  Think we got a good deal with the help of Edmunds pricing."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I rented a 2021 rogue for a trip and hated everything about it. It's very technological, but the tech doesn't work.
The screen reset every 5 minutes, which reset the clock, apps, reverse camera, and radio settings. 

The driving assistance made the car almost dangerous to drive- the laning assistance made it hard to change lanes, and collision detection system made it hard to pass slow vehicles.
The cruise control doesn't work without the collision detection- and the collision detection doesn't work when it rains or snows. So no cruise control, no radio, GPS, reverse camera.

This car was a rental- it was very highly maintained! Not even a year old and already the systems were breaking!
It's large, I guess. That's a plus."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"When I first was given it as my Fleet vehicle I couldn't stop talking about.. I actually thought it was quite nice inside and out and rode really nice.

But now... its all leaks, CVT issues.. now a crazy rumbling in the back end like the AWD system is ever reactive. Dealer has had it for 23 days now as I get in and experience the same thing over and over. THANK GOD I personally didnt buy this and it is only a Fleet vehicle... but still a massive headache non stop having to take it in... and they haven't even began to look at all the leaks it has.. Sun roof, back gate.. A pillar. Thing leaks worse then my 1988 VW Cabriolet leaked."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"This Nissan model is plagued with transmisssion problems, which are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit. 

I bought my 2021 Rogue in December 2020 and it has been in the shop 4 times since May 20211. When I climb the steep hill to my house and push the STOP button, the SUV makes a terrifying clunk of metal on metal and lunges forward! It doesn't normally do this on flat land, but will once in a while.

The Nissan dealer service center (I've been to 3 different ones) claim they don't see the problem--there's no problem if they can't recreate it, mind you. Well, all dealerships are on flat land, not a mountaintop! 

I've contacted Nissan Corporate about their supposed Buy Back Program and was told that I have 2 years left on my manufacturer's warranty and they are just sure it will be addressed in that timeframe. 

There are not many negative reviews for this SUV out there, but I suspect most owners don't drive a 30-degree incline 4x a day, so they may not experience the same problem. 

Though the interior is lovely, cabin technology is current, passenger and cargo space is generous, and handling is good, I still DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SUV BECAUSE OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. I suspect that if I kept it, I'll be sinking thousands into continuous trips to the service center---which will all result in ""we don't see a problem.""

I am trading it in today for a Lexus UX 250h and I pray it does not disappoint me like the Nissan Rogue has. I understand that the Nissan Path Finder has the same transmission with similar problems."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Lots of gizmos, safety features. Comfortable ride. Slow, but not dangerously so. Good steering feel. Brakes are good. So far no glitches or dependability issues.  If you're old enough to have experienced the old GM cars you might remember how good the A/C was in those cars.  Well, I'm currently driving in 90+ Florida weather and I'm constantly having to turn down the air to prevent frostbite.  A real meat locker, in a good sense. The windows are tinted and well insulated, which helps."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"After two years with my 2019 Rouge SV, I decided it was time to step it up in terms of interior quality and performance, I've been a fan of Nissan's for awhile now and when I purchased my 19 it was disappointing that Nissan rehashed the same design yet again, however with the new Rouge it's got a love it or hate it personality to it. My review will be talking about the Platinum version. In my opinion, I REALLY wish Nissan offered a better engine for this year. It's got more power and more ""umph!) then the previous year.. but I think they could have thrown in an engine that delivered my HP and more torque to the wheels, however with that said.. I'd gladly that what they offered anyday vs. the previous model. 

Interior quality is great, the wireless charger pad I wish was bigger. Nissan forgets that there are phones larger than 6.7 inches now, a bigger pad would have been appreciated. The dash is excellent. It's perfect, it's OLED display and since I'm a tech nerd, I love it. It's bright, clear and the heads up display is.. okay. It's a nice feature to have. After a software update wireless apple carplay was offered which is great and has just a hare of lag when switching songs. 

However, looking at the reviews I'd say the SV with tech package (or whatever) is the best way to go, but if you'd want to go all out the top of the line, here is what we got from Nissan is great, you won't be upset with your purchase. ."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Love it perfect for everything size rides great has all safety features
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Lease end of 2018 Nissan Rogue SV with 3 years of no problems at all, great suv. Leased a 2021 Rogue Platinum. Beautiful & has 99% of safety & luxury options as our 2019 Lexus GX460 for a lot less. Very happy with another Nissan Rogue and the dealership we deal with :)?"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"I read all of these reviews before purchasing vehicle.   I purchased a Rogue SL AWD.  I am pleased with the vehicle the only dislikes are a glitchy Apple play only works part of time with Bluetooth connect, but always works when plugged in.  The other Dislike is the front camera cuts in and out when parking vehicle in garage. My favorite part of the Rogue is the styling, the SUV looks great.  Despite my dislikes I would recommend the car as it is a great value compared to the other top rated Compact SUV."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I have the 2021 AWD SL model.  Great handling & comfortable vehicle.  The backup camera is especially nice with all-around view...I hardly ever have to turn my head to see what's behind or around me.  Many, many safety features & convenience options...wonderful! Large trunk area...especially when you put the back seats down.  A/C works great & quickly.  I have the Champagne Silver metallic color...great for hiding dust/dirt & looks classy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like that you have to have the remote so close by to automatically operate the doors.  And the vehicle sits a little high for an average to short person or someone with back issues... but you can program the driver seat to lower upon exiting...so that helps.  I had also considered the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, or a Subaru.  Glad I went with this one.  I bought it in March 2021 & still love it now in Dec 2021."
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"Just got the 2021 rogue sv (traded in my 18 sv). Dealer went over all the new NIFTY  features but never highlighted the removal of some important features of the 18.

This includes, 

Power tailgate
Heated seats
Separated back cargo

I'm also not happy with the location of the ac vents mainly the middle ones.  The bottom lip of the screen blocks the top of the vents and I feel like portion of the air bounces off and is lost"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"The SV AWD has changed on some of the options. If you want heated seats, roof rails, and a cargo cover, you have to get the SV premium package now. I dislike how they made the cargo floor base with a solid mat cover instead of the dual base divided cover with  a hidden storage space underneath. I don’t care for the chocolate brown dashboard and door trim, especially on a gunmetal gray car. I still love the Nissan Rogue SV AWD but miss the extras that I had before."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,I love how it rides...beautiful inside with full sunroof..I dont like the shifter putting into neutral...I have problems with it..
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Great exterior look and sleek design. The all leather interior makes it feel like a luxury SUV without the price tag attached.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Let me Start by saying this is our third rogue. I have owned a Nissan Rogue through practically each iteration and I must say I’m overall very impressed by the improvement this vehicle has made over my 2015. The material quality, technology and just overall look of this vehicle is a significant step forward over the last generation. Our last rogue was traded with just over 100,000 miles and minus basic wear and tear it was a great all around suv. Only complaint I have is I wish they still had the hybrid option available."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,It has a lot of space and it has a lot of features. it has a power moonroof and panoramic moonroof for the front and back. The moonroof is standard on the SV model and up. i own the SL AWD and it is really good. It has a lot of space especially with the seats folded down and it has smooth braking and a soft ride. it is really good with bumpy roads and I would highly recommend this car. it is a really nice car for the compact SUV market.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"We love the new design line of this SUV, it is a vehicle that represents its value, at the same time robust as a large truck, with a lot of comforts, I just hope it will be efficient in service and quality over the years."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"We just a bought our 2021 rogue SV at MSRP $30,800 from a local dealership and currently have 3k miles on it and love it! It gets excellent mpg's and has a lot of tech that you cannot find from the competition at this price point. We hope to have it for a very long time as it's been a great addition to our growing family. It is a Nissan so it should be very reliable if you keep up on the maintenance."
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,I went across country in a 2021 rogue sv. Very enjoyable riding . Panaramic sunroof was great for mountain areas . Never saw problem with power but only carrying  luggage of clothing for me and wife .👍
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,This SUV has it all. Leather Heated Seats and Stirring Wheel. Bose Ten Speaker Audio System. Full Moon Roof. Cameras all around the Car. Power Liftgate. Sirius XM Radio. The 40/60 Back Seats fold down easily. 19” Wheels.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"Great Small SVU, Except for Climate Control.  It is now back for the third time to Napleton Nissan for Heat / Cooling problems.  At first good, then only super hot unless set to lowest setting (Lo) First time nothing done because they could not duplicate problem.  Second time they saw it on super hot both sides all the time.  The said Nissan first requires them to reprogram the computer controller. (why not do that the first time?) Still problems with at 70 degree swing in air temp out of drivers vent on a 45 minute trip to dealer (had photos of car setting and thermometer digital read out that I showed them.)The car was putting out 52 degree air at the dealer when set at 68 when I turned it over to them.  Again they cannot duplicate..  My pictures time and date stamped from that day did NO GOOD.  My first and LAST Nissan"
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I bought a 21 Nissan Rogue Platinum a couple months ago and I have been satisfied with my car, it has what I was looking for."
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,My 2021 Nissan rouge gets stuck in gear and the rpms shoot up to 5-7 thousand rpm. Nissan says they there is nothing wrong. I had a bottom end knock a few days before which they said was normal operation. Very disappointed as this car is only 2 months old and only has 900km on it
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,This is my first car and I am really happy to have it. It's smart and look fantastic with my favourite Orange color ❤️
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,New CVT not working.Service engine notifications. POORLY DONE INSTALLATION OF INTERRIOR LIGHTS.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,The radio is not a great option but overall nice little car if you looking for a small compact suv
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2021 Nissan Rogue SV premium
The car doesnt even have 13 thousand km on it I had check engine lite come on. Brought it to the dealership they said 2 days later I need brand new engine no car for 12 weeks!"
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I took one for a test drive.  I own a 2016 Rogue SV and was excited to drive the new one.  Handling, ride, road noise were all big improvements.  The downside was I felt way more cramped than in my 2016 Rogue.  I'm 6'1 and 240 and I just wouldn't feel comfortable.  The cargo space seemed about the same, maybe smaller.  I wouldn't purchase due to the new model being slightly smaller."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Perfect vehicle for our needs.
Rogue,3 out of 5 stars,"The 2WD SV is my company car... It does everything this kind of vehicle should do. Before this I had a 2014 Ford Escape Titanium which I owned.  Here is how it compares to the escape:

Tech features:
It's not fair to compared a 2014 to a 2021 model, and I'm sure Ford offers some of this in the new Escape, but here is what I like about the Rouge: 
Pro pilot assist- I dig it.  It allows me to devote some of the attention I would have paid to making sure I was centered in my lane and watching the break lights of the vehicle in front of me to looking further up the road to plan which lane I need to be in to get to my exit or avoid slow-downs.  

The 360 degree camera-  I like it.  Very helpful for parking.

Android Auto- most Auto manufacturer Nav systems suck anyway.  All I really want is to have my Google maps from my phone on a bigger screen where I can see it without looking down at my phone, Great!

The stereo- Not as good as the premium system in the Escape, but unless you're a bass-head there's no reason one can't enjoy listening to music on the road with this system.

Interior: It feels kind of fancy. its got a lot of stitching and leather-ish looking surfaces. on the dash and doors. The Cloth upholstery feels soft and durable at the same time, and looks good. 
The cargo space seems more usable than the Escape.  I have an easier time loading bikes and other large objects in the Rouge than in the escape. I don't know if it has more cargo space or it's just the shape.

Driving:  Both the Rouge and the Escape handle admirably well for a Crossover, they're pretty much equal as far as handling goes. My Escape had a 2.0 liter turbo charged engine, but I test drove the 1.6.  Both accelerated better than the Rouge.  The 2.0 Escape had a lot more power. The 1.6 was similar in terms of horse power, but felt a lot faster due to the torque band of the turbo charger and the transmission.  The Rouge just isn't good in terms of power, and the way the CVT delivers it.  The paddles they put on the steering column so I can pretend to shift like a big boy are just an insult to my intelligence, don't placate me like a child Nissan!
The Rouge is efficient for it's size, but I suspect they could have greatly improved the driving experience  by offering a smaller engine with a Turbo and an 8 or 10 speed automatic transmission with only marginal impact on MPG. 

Conclusion: It's a nice, comfortable car that is easy to drive & live with.  I think where they chose to save money to undercut the competition on price was to neglect the power-train... probably not a bad business decision because most of their target market will never push hard enough on the gas pedal on the way to soccer practice or the grocery store to notice the difference. Personally, I like it for a work vehicle someone else is paying for, but if it were my own money, I wouldn't by a CVT unless it were attached to a hybrid power-train like in the Ford Maverick or Subaru Crosstreck to really save some gas, Either that or if you prefer power, a regular transmission with a turbo-charged engine.  All this CVT for efficiency nonsense is a lazy half measure."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Feels great to drive!
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Be ready to get one when u go
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,"The car is technology advanced but an absolute nightmare to drive.
Steering issues pulling vague feel just vile.
The car gives me no sense that the security and driver safety components even work been almost hit backing out of a parking space yet has rear traffic alerts and sensors.
Nissan refuses to do anything so filed a BBB complaint.
Should have got a Bronco Sport guys."
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Great car
Our second Rogue"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Love every aspect of it.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,front windshield washer SUCKS who ever came up with this ideal is an idiot
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Price appropriately
Rogue,2 out of 5 stars,"You think with all the extras in my new 2021 premium they would have a better factory command start. Mine never works every now and then it might. And you can never tell if it does start because the key fob doesn’t beep or anything. Even when I stand beside the vehicle it won’t start unless it feels like it. As for the starter app. That is faulty too. App tells you door is locked, but vehicle doesn’t start because I don’t get a notification until after I go out and physically start the vehicle. Then! I get the notification. And no it is not cold outside! My 2014 Equinox starts great with its cheap and on command start package. By the way I work in AUTOBODY"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,"Great ride, great on gas, second rogue and love it"
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,I like this SUV. It will take a while for me to get used to bells and whistles of this vehicle.
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,Truly enjoying my new Rogue!
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,This Rogue is peppy and comfortable riding!
Rogue,5 out of 5 stars,I’ve always wanted an SUV and my Nissan Rogue did not disappoint. I got the premium package and I love everything about it.
Rogue,1 out of 5 stars,This car is riddles with issues. Check engine light constantly comes on during cold weather. Had a few instance where the car decelerating when trying to accelerate and merging into traffic. Very dangerous and feel frustrated since it’s a brand new car. Will try to get Lemon law and get rid of it ASAP!
Rogue,4 out of 5 stars,"I bought my 2021 Nissan Rogue in December of 2021, it is now April 2022. It drives nice an has decent road manners however, acceleration is poor unless the vehicle is in sport mode. When driving down the highway in sport mode it has difficulty finding a gear that it’s happy which and the RPMs shoot up between 5000 & 7000 and just maintains there until you shift back to normal drive mode. Fuel economy is great much better than my previous Armada, I average about 28mpg (I have a lead foot). Interior quality for the SV trim with premium package is really nice and has great looking materials and finishes, the only complaint with the interior is the shift knob. I can shift the knob just fine but the Park button on top is already fading. I understand as things age they fade and discolor but the car is only 4 months old. Wish the vehicle had wireless apple car play and android auto, seems dated to have to plug the phone in. I consider this vehicle to be tough, it currently has almost 7000 miles on it and haven’t had any issue other than the above stated transmission/acceleration issues. I once ran over top of a deer doing 75 mph when the car beside me hit it and flung it in my lane. No exterior damage or undercarriage damage was noted when taken to the dealership, alignment was still spot on and no check engine lights came on."
