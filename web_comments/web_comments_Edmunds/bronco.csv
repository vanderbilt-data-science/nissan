bronco,3 out of 5 stars,"2 days off the lot, torque converter locks up.  Takes a month for Ford to decide what to do.  Another 22 days for the transmission to be replaced.  Engine does not sound the same. there is a light rattle and some oil or fluid may be leaking from the engine/transmission area.  In an independant shop today. About two months out now."
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my Bronco Sport for a little over a month and the AC compressor already has gone out. Ford said there’s no parts in stock and I have to wait months until they are available. On top of that, they said there’s no loaner cars available. I paid over MSRP with extended full comprehensive warranty and this is what happens.

I would think twice before buying this car. Extremely disappointed."
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"Bronco sport looks great and is fun to drive, when it is running.
We have 2400miles on a 2021 First Edition ad the engine failed.
It has been in the shop(about 2 months) at the dealer longer than it has been in the garage at my house.
Take my advice and wait a couple of years until they get the bus worked out"
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"Picked up Bronco Sport First Edition in May.  Currently at 4700 miles after completing a 3000 mile road trip.  Bronco performed wonderfully during the road trip, which included driving through down pour.  During an errand,  my wife was unable to start the Bronco warning lights flashing and alerts being generated and the parking light was flashing on the shift knob.  The Bronco started after holding down the start button for over a minute and after the system cycled through the error messages.  Bronco has been with at the dealership for over five days.  Dealer thinks possible electrical problem but still researching.  Contacted Ford customer support to log problem ticket for some sort of compensation."
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,"36k  price.  Loved this car up until I hit 2400 miles or less.  Noticed when I backed up and turned out of my drive way;  I heard a loud rough grinding noise last Thursday. I took it in the following morning to Ford they backed up two times but heard nothing and tried to send me away.   I insisted on them checking it out again.  Left it overnight and they still don’t know what is going on with it.  Not too happy with the Bronco Big Bend now.   Have an escape that is  not making the noise when I back up and turn out of my driveway. 
Anyone experiencing this??"
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,Had  power train malfunction warning lights going off as I was driving it off the lot. Warning lights go off every-time I drive it. Was in shop 3 weeks of the 1 month I owned it. Ford refusing buyback . I tell anyone & everyone I know not to buy a Bronco because Ford doesn’t back their cars.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"So far I’m loving everything about this from the look to the feel to the little details. It’s a pretty basic Big Bend model with the tow package and not too many other upgrades. I’m not one for extras and wanted to keep the pricing as reasonable as possible.

I am in South Jersey and haven’t seen a single other one on the road yet...this is definitely turning heads. If there is one thing I’m not crazy about, it is the “Auto-Stop” function that shuts down the car at lights. I’m really not used to this and it feels kinda rough when it re-starts after shutting off for the light. Luckily it is possible to disable it and I haven’t used it at all. 

Ive driven it a pretty good deal both city and highway over the past couple days and am really really enjoying it! I’ve mostly stayed in “standard” mode (option of Standard, Sport, Eco, Sand, Slippery) and have been getting PHENOMENAL gas mileage all things considered. Also a very smooth and consistent ride as long as I keep the frigging auto stop/start disabled. Feels good on acceleration despite some reports of it feeling a little sluggish. Not mine! Feels great up in the 60-75 range too...nice and powerful. I’m not pushing it at all until I hit over 1500k on the miles. 

Absolutely in love with it so far!"
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love my Ford Bronco Sport.  I've had it for six months now and have replaced the windshield THREE TIMES!!! Any little pebble that could be a chip is actually a crack that runs pretty much across the glass.  This is definitely an issue that Ford needs to address.  I've spoken with my service advisor and he had nothing to say.  This should be a recall.  I cannot keep claiming poor quality windshields to be repaired by my insurance.  RECALL THESE WINDSHIELDS!
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Big Bend model in June, and within a few days, the information display went blank. It came back on, but it has gone off and on for a month. I finally got an appointment to take it in last Friday after waiting 3 weeks. The service dept. had it from 8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., and they couldn't replicate the issue. I gave them pictures of the blank screen from several different dates. I brought it back home. This morning, Monday, I started it up, and the information display was blank. I drove it straight to Ford and kept it running until the tech came out, plugged his computer into the car, and said ""the computer"" wasn't showing any problems. He said they will have to contact Ford to see what they want to do about it. Boo Hiss...I gave up my 2015 Ford Fusion that had next to zero problems during the 6 years I drove it for issues within days of purchase.

UPDATE 9/4/2021: They replaced the instrument panel, and I've had no issues with it so far for the last month or so."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I bought my Bronco Sport Outer Bank mid September 2021 and I love it.  I traded in my 2019 Ranger XLT and the Bronco Sport is a better size vehicle for me plus it is more fun to drive the Bronco Sport.  I have had many compliments on the looks of my Bronco Sport which is white with the black top.  I was a little concerned that a 3 cylinder engine at 181 HP wouldn't have much power but I was definitely wrong.  It has plenty of power.  The seats are comforable and the ride is very good for a short wheel based SUV.  On a recent trip of 2,500 miles including city miles, I got 28.8 MPG.  I was driving 75 MPH on the highway so I was quite pleased with the mileage and that trip was done with the ""Normal"" setting, not ""Economy"".  I do have two small complaints, the engine will rattle a little on idle and the visors are a little too big.  If I put them down in the front, quite a bit of my view is blocked from the road.  Ford needs to put a smaller visor in the Bronco Sport."
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,"Have had the bronco sport for 4 months. The WIFI stopped working had to reboot entire computer system. Front fender mud flaps have both fallen off, bluetooth cuts in and out constantly, back window leaks water into the car every time it rains or go through car wash, tons of rocks are stuck in my rubber trim due to design flaw on car. Dont buy until they get it right. To top if off they want me to leave my car for a day or two and will not give me a replacement"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Just had the opportunity to drive the Badland edition, and I really liked it. I immediately dismissed it previously as a rebadged Escape, but I was surprised. Firstly, very good driving experience. The engine has good power, the steering has good feedback and great on-center feel, and it's refined. It felt really solid, and I was not expecting that at all. On the highway, I caught myself going over the speed limit many times due to its refinement. Comfortable interior, and really powerful heating/heated seats. I just really loved how solid it felt going down the road. The AWD system is really good! Turning off the stability control, it was really easy to get rotation in the snow.  I had to drive it to the airport during a snow storm, and it felt so stable on the highway!!! The headlights are really good! Really, I wasn't expecting to like it so much since I drove a new Escape and it felt really different. I liked the stiff ride, as it imparted a solid feel to the vehicle. The driving position is great, and it looks great in person. Like a mini LR Defender. The sculpted hood is really cool to look at when driving. Lastly, I loved the size of it. Truly maneuverable and agile. In terms of downsides, the 2.0T seemed to really eat gas. Probably because of the aerodynamics and the good performance. Also, the speakers were truly mediocre. There was a very obvious rattle under heavy bass. Overall, I'd really recommend it. It's priced higher than other subcompact SUVs, but it truly feels more expensive due to its solidity, good performance, and solid driving dynamics. I'm a fan!

Edit: The transmission calibration was significantly better than in the Escape. That was one of my biggest qualms I had with the Escape. In the Bronco Sport, it felt pretty well tuned."
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,"Bought the Bronco Sport and within a week I noticed some strange creaks and rattles. Long story short, had to have the entire transmission replaced and while the noises became more subtle/quieter they still existed. The windshield glass also started to crack. You’ll read on the forums about owner transmission problems along with the windshield glass being fragile. Bronco Sports are made in Mexico which is notorious for having quality issues. These vehicles are all looks and cheap short cuts underneath. I can’t see these vehicles having long term viability and no regrets about selling mine. Compared to its competitors, the BS build quality is really quite poor."
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,I purchased my vehicle April 2021 with approximate 50 miles so brand new. When driving it vibrates sporadically. When I reverse in the morning it makes this loud hard noise which was scary at first. I tried to schedule an appointment they didnt have any and could not provide a loaner car. I’m at 5800 miles tried to make appointment through the app during the month of September there is no availability. I’m just going to go in tomorrow and hope to have some luck.
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"Be aware! My moonroof/sunroof shattered/ exploded and came off my frame while driving, the scariest thing ever, I had to have the car towed to dealership. They just all seemed baffled and said they’d do everything go get it fixed Bc the car is 4 months old. The dealership/ford has no answers for me, other than waiting on a service rep to make a decision on my car/life/livelihood that I’m paying on and not driving, how does that make any sense?! It’s been weeks, I’m beyond devastated having this happen to a brand new car. I will not EVER be buying a ford"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I have the Badlands model that comes with the 2.0 liter engine.  I average 26.8 mpg at 4700 miles with highway mileage 29-33 (driving the speed limit.)  The interior seating is comfortable on long trips.  The back seats have limited space but are functional.  It has plenty of storage in the back which expands when the back seats are put down.  I have had no issues at all and just completed my first oil change.  The Badlands comes with a front facing camera that I use when parking to ensure I am where I need to be.  The front camera comes on automatically when engaging Rock Crawl, Mud/Ruts, or Sand mode.  It comes with Ford Co-Pilot 360 and Automatic High Beams which is very nice-automatically going to high beam and switching back with oncoming traffic.  The Co-Pilot 360 takes a bit to get used to if you have never used it before with the lane assist/centering, blind spot alerts, and pre-collision assist but it is very nice and provides for additional safety.  I have been very pleased with the performance of the vehicle and have zero regrets purchasing it.  As you read other reviews, remember all vehicles can have problems-the warranty addresses those.  Drive it yourself, see if it fits your needs, and if you purchase it-enjoy!  There are several Bronco Sport forums that assist with questions, problems, and a lot of ideas for personalizing it.  One year update-almost 10K miles and still running strong with no issues. MPG is about the same - average 26.6 overall since purchase.  Very impressed the the quality of the BS.  I have driven off-road several times and it did well. Buy or order with confidence!"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had my Big Bend edition and simply LOVE it. Ford really nailed the perfect mix of fun, utility, and super fun feel good vibe. Even though mine has the smaller engine it has plenty of power and pickup. Everywhere I go people stop and admire it. It has an excellent driving height so you can see the road great. Admittedly, if I’m ever on the sand it’s because I got lost, but having so many GOAT modes is a nice touch."
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,Blue tooth and sync is not good mine keeps going out on turning off in middle of using it no matter what Mobile device I use.
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"As nice as it looks I only got to enjoy mine for 27 days, mine was rear ended and was totaled. The thing is my car with two others were at a complete stop when car #3 got rear ended the bronco barely got tapped and the impact bar crumpled. There is zero durability to the Ford bronco and when Ford is asked questions about it they ignore the consumer. Beyond disappointed."
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,7998 miles on a 2021 big bend Branco and stuck transmission will not shift rotates shift knob by itself from drive to park stranded on vacation.  Other than that has no power and weird to drive
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,If you want to turn your back on the boring everyday SUV’s that all look the same then the Bronco is for you. I traded in an Acura RDX for my Bronco because it was uninspiring. The RDX was an excellent vehicle but looked like all the others. I feel safe in the Bronco which is something I haven’t felt since I owned a Toyota FJ Cruiser. I finally feel like driving again for no reason other than to take my Bronco out. The only thing I miss about the RDX was the memory seats.
bronco,3 out of 5 stars,I have had my vehicle for 3 months. So far the main screen behind the steering wheel goes completely blank. Unable to show mph etc. However after turning on and off several times it does eventually come back. Also I was just driving down the road and the rear glass window exploded. I thought someone may have thrown something at it but no one was around. Very scary! I have been advised of a recall as well with the gas line which I inquired about and a Ford Dealership said to come back they have not been provided the part to fix it with yet. 😔😔
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I traded in my Mercedes for this sleek, safe and very cool small SUV. Feels like luxury vehicle on the inside and the ride is extremely smooth. Very well thought out details for the price!"
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,"I owned the big bend for 4 months and just traded it in for a Subaru Forester. The front seats are not comfortable, no leg room on the back seat, lacy of cargo space, ride is noisy, inside is cheap plastic, hood rattles while driving, lack of power and smoothness, auto stop feature is anything but convenient and for the price (34k) it was bit worth it in my opinion which is why I ended up trading it in."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"As I said, at first I was afraid to drive it, but now I am making excuses to take it on the road.  It is so fun to drive!  People look at the car and really do not know what to think.  Broncos have not been on the road for years, and now they are, and are better than ever!!!"
bronco,3 out of 5 stars,"Driving it for 7 months in Northern Michigan.  Summer was great but regular sized bike will not fit inside with inside rack.Bright lights are great but dims do not shine out very far and deer are a serious issue!  At 55 you are slamming the brakes by the time deer, or amything, comes into view.  Winter:  handles well in the snow and ice.  The wheel wells get completely filled with ice and difficult to remove.  Tires constantly rub on the buildup. The  cavity that hides the wipers fills up with ice and snow and freezes rendering the wipers useless unless you stop and try to remove all the ice and snow from around them which I'd difficult.  Great southern car or one kept in a garage."
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy driving my Bronco Sport! Have owned 8 months and driven over 7,000 miles. Was concerned about the 1.5 engine but it hasn't disappointed with easy highway ramp acceleration and passing on two lane highway. Also handling is great with flat cornering and a tight turn radius. View out windshield is great. Headlights are best I have ever head for visibility on dark country roads and bad weather. Cargo area easily handled my load of bagged mulch this summer and the large box a new power washer came in. I  rarely have passengers in the back seats, so the one drawback of lack of foot room especially when entering or exiting back seat isn't a huge problem for me personally. Zero squeaks or rattles but there is some wind noise at higher speeds and a hard rain hitting the roof makes some noise."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,I kniow I'm one of the first to driving a Big Bend Bronco and it's awesome!  The looks are Sweet! My surfboards fit in the back both outside the liftup glass or inside after folding down the seats if needed! Lots of head room and places to store things. Can't believe it's mine!
bronco,2 out of 5 stars,"I love the looks.  I love the size.  I love the exterior and the interior.    I previously had two Ford Escapes and knew the Escape platform was the basis for the Bronco Sport.   BUT...I should have examined the bronco more closely, and if you're thinks of buying one, so should you.  The driver's seat is too low, even at its maximum.  And worse....I would even say dangerous...the gas pedal is further away , and much smaller, than the break pedal.  So if you practice heel/ toe driving, you will find that if you position your heel so as to use the brake, only your toes will reach the gas.  In fact, your foot can easily slide off the gas pedal altogether, and could conceivably slip UNDER.  And conversely, if you position your foot to rest properly and effectively on the gas pedal, you may have to lift your leg or slide your foot back to apply the brake.  This seems like an accident waiting to happen."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Good looking vehicles. Comes with a  lot of standard equipment. Very stylish, smooth ride, power when needed, comfortable. Over all it is one of the  best vehicles we have ever had. Truly worth the price."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Love my Bronco. Drives nice, rides nice too! Handles great and the new color Area 51 is the eye candy of the year!"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Wow I bought about a month ago 2021 Broncos sport big bend.ford you get a plus for this vehicle . its more than I could imagine! I must say great looks love color catcus grey,love all the features that come with it ,lot of room inside handles great,good on gas and gets you where you want to go.   Ford what took you so long to bring it back.q"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I have 8500 miles on my big bend and so far so good! I’ve been off road around the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson and the White mountains in northern Arizona and my Bronco handled like a champ! If I can complain about anything, it would be that the bronco sport could sit a little higher. I am putting a lift kit and off road tires on it next month and can’t wait to get my bronco sport dirty again!"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable vehicle.  I purchased an Outerbanks model and absolutely love my Bronco. I'm learning about all it's interior features at present time. I love the look of this vehicle. Very,  very comfortable ride. I can't wait to take my friends on a day trip to Hill Country here in TX."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,Took delivery in April......driven 8500 miles in it.......comfy quiet........easy to drive........does everything well........mpg since purchase......33.7...combined.......no mechanical issues so far.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Everyone’s needs are different and for me, Bronco Sport Outer Banks is excellent “dog mom” little SUV. It also helped that my experiences with George Coleman Ford in Travelers Rest, SC made it particularly stress-free (I haven’t bought a brand new car from a dealership in many years, so I was leery). It’s nice interacting with people that don’t use high-pressure tactics and that honor their words (thanks Chase and Gerald!). I’m still discovering little “bells and whistles” everyday that I didn’t realize I wanted or needed (like auto sensing on/off of high beams). The temps are cooling quickly and I live in the country, so things like remote start and remembering your climate settings (heated seats, steering wheel) all really nice in the morning for doggie day care drop-off.  My Bronco handles my 1/4 mile gravel driveway (obscured with leaves in some sections) with ease - happily takes on mountain roads and switchbacks with ease. The one “wish” is that I still haven’t figured out how to save some of my preferred defaults (likely user error - definitely not a show stopper). Enjoy!"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Great vehicle, rides like a little truck.  The whole family really like riding in it.  It's loaded and comfortable to ride I both on and off the road."
bronco,3 out of 5 stars,Trans shudder at lower speeds after 2000 miles. Ford replaced torque converter and valve body. Trans shifted better and no shudder. 500 miles after repair shudder is back and transmission sounds like a loose chain at times. I hope they replace the complete transmission as I don't want to go through this a third time.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Bought a ford Broncos sport big bend. Soon as I saw the big bend Broncos feel in love with it.love the color caucus grey,love the style looks power and room inside and great gas miles."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"It’s a great little car. It can off road but don’t buy it if you think it’s bad ass. It’s not. Snow, ice, some mud and sand that’s not to deep are all within it’s capabilities.

The big bend has good safety features and for the price it’s a fun little guy"
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"Fun to drive - in town, on the freeway or the back roads.  Really a nice vehicle."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,It's a 5 person SUV built for camping.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,They are hard to find right now.  Expect not to get much of of the sticker price right now.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,"I love it, it is so fun to drive and comfortable."
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,Omg the best vehicle i have Ever Owned...so excited
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,Only had it one day too soon to tail loving it so far
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,A spunky 4wd that rides like a car❤️
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,For the money great deal
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,What else can I say? :)
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,Great ride beautiful color! Love the moon roof and wheels!
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,"Loved the vehicle, but the sound system was disappointing, there was no dual climate control, and luxury finishes were lacking."
bronco,4 out of 5 stars,I really this car but i would’ve perfected a few more luxuries like ventilated seats wireless apple car play.
bronco,5 out of 5 stars,The 2021 Bronco Sport (Outerbanks model) is such a great vehicle.  I love it. I drove a sedan for about 12 years and would never go back to driving a Sedan. This SUV has a smooth ride and is very quite. I'm able to get in and out of vehicle quite easily.  It sits tall people. I can even wear a hat while driving! I love my Baby Bronco!
bronco,1 out of 5 stars,"My brand new bronco sport started making knocking whirring noises immediately. Stopped going into drive and ended up stranded in a busy intersection. Ford says it’s the transmission and will be 2 months in the shop by the time parts even get here, longer than I’ve had it. Extremely disappointed with this buying experience, be aware."
