"I had a 18 honda crv and felt bored and everyone has one. This suv was definitely not the crown honda raves about.
Seen a bad lands 6 weeks ago and became obsessed. After looking I realized you cannot get one easy. 4 weeks, 118 miles and buying sight unseen or have driven one I bought it over the phone. This is not me or my personality. I crewed off every finger nail till I got to the dealership. I seen my grey cactus waiting for me. Feel in love from that day on. No issues with it in 5 weeks. I get looks and stopped weekly with questions. People go nuts and want my opinion. Only car I look at daily and drive that I havea huge smile. Love the 2.0 v4 turbo. It flies. Not a single regret and thank you ford for my love."
"Ordered a lovely cyber orange color Bronco sport , production delays and i’m still waiting. 
I see stock car getting to dealers but not my customer order. It’s a fairly simple Badlands version with a tow package .
I found almost the same suv  just delivered to a dealer but without the tow package AND a $5000 over sticker cost! (Where’s mine?).
If I’m going to spend $40k on a vehicle I’m not buying off the lot and getting more or less that I want , I expect to have this car for 15 years as my retirement vehicle and don’t want to live with a compromise!
Fortunately I can wait. But it’s disappointing to see stock builds getting priority over a customer order. I guess Ford wants to protect their dealers who are struggling with lack of product to sell.
Maybe I can update this if I ever get to drive it!"

"Awesome fun. Road Trip tested.  24,000 miles and 11 states so far.  Zero issues.  7 speed Manual shifts easy. Plenty of power from 2.3L engine.

Area 51 gets lots of compliments.   Hard top is nice and looks good."
Good Looking
not reliable. Poor consumer experience from Ford
"The Bronco Sport is definitely cool looking but beware if something goes wrong. My BS went crazy while driving with all the dash lights shutting off and gave an error message on the navigation screen. The car wouldn't restart. Dealerships can't get it in until 2-6 weeks for diagnostics. And the warranty won't kick in to cover the rental car until diagnostics are done. Oh, and you know the dealers got greedy and sold all of their loaner cars. 2 weeks of rental car is over $1,000. This is the Ford way so beware. I should have stuck with the Japanese brands.  

The vehicle is nice to drive. Quality is okay. The steering wheel was horrible, had to get a cover for it. Some rattles that I asked about getting fixed months ago but again they said I would have to leave the car for 2 weeks."

"I have owned a whopping 85 vehicles in my life, and the Bronco FE is the very best I have owned. The ride for a OFF ROAD SUV type is way past my expectations and the fuel mileage I get somehow seems to be better than what is noted. Off road there are non that compare. I usually buy a truck and dream of my next purchase a couple of months later but that feeling is nowhere to be found and will always have this Bronco and others throughout the rest of my days. BUY ONE.."

"Auto start/stop, rear view wiper motor blind spot"
"I’ve had my Bronco Sport for just over a year, but only driven 8500 miles with no long road trips yet.  I moved up from a 2009 Escape which I loved, but the Bronco is even better and more capable for rougher road conditions.  Perfect size for my needs.  Small enough for easy maneuvering and parking, but big enough to see over other traffic.  Enough room for me and a buddy and our outdoor gear.  Roof rack handles 2 kayaks easily.  Badlands edition with off road tires has plenty of power and still gets decent gas mileage (about 25 mpg combined).  Love the unique retro style that sets it apart from the sea of SUV’s.  Minor downsides: don’t care for the auto start/stop feature, and I’m still not in the habit of disabling it every time I start up.  Rear window wiper motor creates a blind spot.  Overall, very happy with this vehicle."
Fun to Drive
Small Back Leg Room but not a big issue
"Is a kind of SUV that you said nice...but when you enter this vehicle you WOW!!! Have every single detail to get everything! I run for 3 hours (120 miles ride) and just take les than a quarter of the gas thank. Is comfort, AutoPilot, 360 camera, nice audio system and a freaking table in the back!! All weather cares and to close... 3cilinder + turbo = Power"
Great little sports truck and SO fun to drive!
None so far
"This is my first Ford and I’m impressed!  This vehicle handles great in snow & ice on the hills and the straightaway’s. I haven’t had one issue with this truck. And that’s not all… this truck is sooo cool looking! I get looks everywhere I go!! It gets pretty good gas mileage and the engine shut off at stop lights doesn’t bother me. I had a Lexus hybrid before I bought my baby Bronco (BIG step up for me) so I was sort of used to it. The Bronco Sport’s turn radius is super tight and I was amazed at how comfortable a ride it has.
I was lucky and found my Outer Banks on a lot. I got her for sticker price and she was loaded with all the bells and whistles- the only thing this one didn’t have that I sort of wanted was a moon roof. With the chip shortage that wasn’t possible at the time. 
I love Co-pilot 360 assist, remote start, the rubber floor mats, heated seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, rain sensing wipers, and the Bang & Olufsen stereo, etc. I can live without the moon roof. 
My interior is great quality and really cool looking!  I think the quality of the interior is excellent if you get the Outer Banks, Badlands or First Edition. If you get the base or Big Bend  models the interior is cheap. 
All in all, I think the Ford Bronco Sport Outer Banks is an awesome vehicle and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
Fun to drive. Very comfortable.

"This is the best vehicle, by far, that I've ever owned. The comfort level, especially on long trips, is incredible. This vehicle is equipped with the Badlands package, just about everything you need. I say, ""just about"", because there is one thing it should come with, an automated rear lift gate. The power it has with the larger eco boost engine is awesome. Place this baby in sport mode and it gets crazy fast. My wife and I absolutely love this car."

"Just purchased our Bronco Sport (Base) three weeks ago.  I've been enamored with the Bronco for quite some time and finally made the decision to purchase 'Sarge' and enjoy the unique Bronco Sport ownership experience.  I love this machine.  I purchased the Base model because it was the only one on the dealer's lot and the only one available to purchase within 200 miles.  The only other option was to order one and wait a year for delivery.  I'm not getting any younger, so when the dealer offered to drive the vehicle to me and perform the contract on the dining room table, I agreed and I'm glad I did.  As a caraholic, I've had many vehicles in my life and this Bronco is unique to any other I've owned; most of which were hot rods (Corvettes, Mustangs and a Shelby GT) or pickup trucks.  Because the Base model has no hi-tech options, I thought I would miss them, but I found that the 'Base Model' driving experience is much more enjoyable than I ever would have imagined.  I really wanted the 4-cylinder option, but settled for the 180 HP three banger since I had no other choice.  I'm not disappointed; however, because 'Sarge' (you can tell I'm a 30-year military guy) gets down the road and off road just fine.  In 'Eco' GOAT mode, I'm averaging 26 MGP which is pretty doggone good for a 4-wheel drive off-road oriented machine.  My wife's 2020 Escape (same chassis) provides a totally different driving experience in regards to comfort etc. Thus far, I'm quite pleased with the vehicle and my decision to purchase it.  If that changes, I'll let you know..."

"I absolutely love this car. I am an outdoorsy person and am in the mountains a lot. This offers everything I need in a car for my adventures. Its great at climbing (not hard-core climbing), its great in snow, its great on the highway. It offers amazing safety features and has already saved me from a collision with a deer on the highway with its auto braking system. It offers plenty of space for gear and extra passengers as well as my dogs. The convenience features are just phenomenal. The gas mileage is wonderful for its class. Its totally reliable and I know no matter where I am traveling we will be fine whether on the highway, off road, snow or rain we're safe and will get there without issue."
Fun to drive and look at!
Soft top can be noisy at times
"After decades of waiting, the latest Ford bronco is 100% worth it. The technology package for on road driving is best in class and continues to amaze me every day. Adaptive cruise control, Lane keep assist, seat warmers, etc. don’t even scrape the surface of comfort. The off-road technology is even better, including 4H and 4L, and allowing you to disconnect stay bars, lock front and/or rear dif. And trail assist is fun too. Love the car!!!"

One small annoyance is the automatic engine shutoff.  I disable it every time I drive.  I would like to be able to disable full time."

"I have the standard Bronco Sport. I drove this vehicle from San Francisco CA to Wichita KS with a dog, a cat, a relative, and about 200 pounds worth of gear. Never had a problem. Drove through AZ desert, the engine never overheated. We slept in the car to save $ on hotels, it was comfortable enough to sleep in the driver's seat. Also (and I think the most important) this vehicle somehow was able to ""see"" the lane lines on roads where they had been worn away. Despite me not being able to see the lane line's this vehicle kept me in my lane and kept me alert when competing for room on small roadways with 18 wheelers. I have driven Toyota's, Honda's, and even a Tesla. The Toyota had to be persuaded to Go, meaning I had to hit the gas several times to get it off the line. The Honda had multiple blind spots along it get up and go issues. The Tesla kept second-guessing my next move which would sometimes have it breaking on its own in the middle of the freeway. Even a year into owning this vehicle I have had no issues and cant up-talk this vehicle enough. Well done Ford!"
