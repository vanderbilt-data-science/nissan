"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

"Owned 2 CX 5 and 1 CX 7, 
Buying the Signature CX 5 Turbo was the best decision I ever made. For a SUV it is fun, easy to handle, great delivery on speed when you need. Elegant interior and stylish exterior. I added extra chrome to give it a personalize look."
Fun and quick
"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
"I have the turbo and it’s a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
Everything
The small exhaust tips
"I can’t say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I’ve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."
Sharp driving experience
Bose only on highest trim levels
"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
Everything!
Nothing
I absolutely love this crossover!!! It’s definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
Fun to Drive definitely
Interior space
"I took the base model, and I’m fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it’s the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.

Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."

"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."

Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
Everything!
Nothing
I absolutely love this crossover!!! It’s definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
Fun to Drive definitely
Interior space
"I took the base model, and I’m fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it’s the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

"Owned 2 CX 5 and 1 CX 7, 
Buying the Signature CX 5 Turbo was the best decision I ever made. For a SUV it is fun, easy to handle, great delivery on speed when you need. Elegant interior and stylish exterior. I added extra chrome to give it a personalize look."
Fun and quick
"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
"I have the turbo and it’s a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.

"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

"Owned 2 CX 5 and 1 CX 7, 
Buying the Signature CX 5 Turbo was the best decision I ever made. For a SUV it is fun, easy to handle, great delivery on speed when you need. Elegant interior and stylish exterior. I added extra chrome to give it a personalize look."
Fun and quick
"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
"I have the turbo and it’s a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
Everything
The small exhaust tips
"I can’t say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I’ve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."
Sharp driving experience
Bose only on highest trim levels
"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
Everything!
Nothing
I absolutely love this crossover!!! It’s definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
Fun to Drive definitely
Interior space
"I took the base model, and I’m fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it’s the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.

- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."

The small exhaust tips
"I can’t say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I’ve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."

Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
Everything!
Nothing
I absolutely love this crossover!!! It’s definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
Fun to Drive definitely
Interior space
"I took the base model, and I’m fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it’s the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

"Owned 2 CX 5 and 1 CX 7, 
Buying the Signature CX 5 Turbo was the best decision I ever made. For a SUV it is fun, easy to handle, great delivery on speed when you need. Elegant interior and stylish exterior. I added extra chrome to give it a personalize look."
Fun and quick
"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
"I have the turbo and it’s a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
"I just purchased a 2017 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with all the bells and whistles and I must say - wow - color me very impressed.  

I have only put about 150 miles on it so far, but in this short time it has been nothing short of stunning.  This vehicle hits way above its weight class, it feels more like an 80k SUV rather than a 40k SUV.  

In typical Mazda fashion (and like the previous generation CX-5), the driving dynamics are simply spectacular for a crossover. It handles like it weighs a thousand lbs less than it does, the electric-steering actually has some tactile feedback that most other numb electric steering vehicles simply lack, and bonus - the ride is substantially improved over the last generation CX-5.  No more jolting shots through the spine when hitting a bump or a pot hole.  But that handling - wow.  Slicing through the Colorado canyons is a blast, it feels like a sports car.  But this is nothing new for Mazda.

Then there is all the little things - refinement details that only a small company like a Mazda can do that the large companies seem to miss for the same price category; great soft interior materials all around, excellent french stitching, perfectly centered steering wheel, well placed knobs and buttons, multiple USB ports both front and back, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated steering wheel, and everything inside just feels like it was designed to revolve around the driver.  

The amount of sound deadening they used vs the previous gen has really paid off as well, as the road noise is basically nill and the engine noise is lessened.  

The 2.5L Skyactiv naturally-aspirated inline 4 in this refresh has a beautiful throaty sound for a 4-banger, and it pulls very linearly on both ends.  Throttle response from a dead stop is a bit laggy requiring more throttle than I prefer, but I am hoping a custom tune helps with that. Other than that, this engine has plenty of pickup, so I am not really quite sure why it gets panned so much for not having enough power - it has plenty to move this machine around.  Oh and the transmission has been excellent so far - very firm quick shifts without a hint of harshness. 

Where it really stands out over the previous gen though is in the technology.  Beautiful 7 widescreen display on the dash operated by a dial on the center console (simply the easiest way to use such a system), backup camera and GPS navigation that shows on display, stop & go radar that really works, automatic high/low beam LED adaptive headlights that bend with the turn, and an active heads-up display that projects the vehicle speed onto the windshield.  It will even display upcoming road signs on the windshield, as well as upcoming turns and distance until target for the navigation. It has lane-assist and blind spot technology too, but I find most of that to be more annoying than helpful.  Thankfully nearly everything can be enabled or disabled in the settings, along with various sensitivity settings.

Overall after spending many years previously driving boring and bland crossovers, this SUV just makes driving FUN again. Do yourself a favor - even if have a recent previous gen CX-5 - and run over to your local Mazda dealer for a test drive.  You wont regret it."
"Because of all the great online reviews and hype, I really wanted to love this car but I ended up trading it after only 2 months. This is the only car I have ever traded so soon after buying it. I usually keep my cars for 8-10 years.  Thinking that my old BMW could have potential engine problems, I traded it for the CX-5 signature thinking that is was a good choice and great value for all the features. But I soon found out that I was so wrong. The CX-5 features starting getting on my nerves. The heads-up display was distracting, the beeping from the safety features were annoying (I don't like a bossy car!), the non-touch screen was frustrating, the cup holders were in a bad place, the armrest was too short that I couldn't use it--it's positioned too far back for a female driver, the seats are too straight that I would slide while making turns, the window line is too high--it's too small going through a drive-thru as there is not a good clearance to receive orders, the back windows do not fully roll down, it does not have knee airbags, the heated steering wheel only partially heats—I would touch cold parts during backing out, the key fob is a cheap quality with small buttons on the side that are difficult to see, the car is a gas guzzler with a small gas tank (I didn't like all the extra stops for gas and the flimsy gas lid), the turbo lags, the ride is bumpy, the interior paint around the inside doors is cheap and does not have a gloss coat like the car exterior, the wheel wells have cheap felt inside them making them difficult to clean, the interior lighting is poor even with the included floor lighting in the signature, and the driver's side leather seat was starting to wrinkle after only 2 months! Also, I did not like the goofy grin on the grill of the car. The worst part was the dark and depressing interior. The size of the sunroof was incredibly disappointing. I didn't realize how much I'd miss having a panoramic sunroof. I honestly started to hate this car and could not wait to get rid of it.  I looked at several luxury SUVs, and ended up trading the CX-5 for another (new) BMW X3. Thankfully, I pay cash for my cars so it was an easy trade-in. The BMW drives like a dream with a smoother transmission and ride, much better build quality, has a light interior with lots of lighting including ambient, a panoramic sunroof, and a bigger gas tank with better gas mileage. I'm so happy driving it! Got a great deal. It didn't cost much more than a CX-5 signature. I'd rather have a true luxury vehicle for this price range. I won't make that mistake again."

"Owned 2 CX 5 and 1 CX 7, 
Buying the Signature CX 5 Turbo was the best decision I ever made. For a SUV it is fun, easy to handle, great delivery on speed when you need. Elegant interior and stylish exterior. I added extra chrome to give it a personalize look."
Fun and quick
"Lots of body roll when cornering, bad gas mileage"
"I have the turbo and it’s a lot of
fun to drive! My only issues are the really bad gas mileage (about 17mpg city), and the suspension is way too soft and squirrelly for the torque."
"Quality leather seating, and a very nice ride!"
Needs more HP/poor around town MPG!
"MPG around town is well below the EPA sticker estimates, which of course negatively effects average combined MPG. Observing the real-time MPG gauge, the MPG from 0-25 MPH is below 10 and doesn't exceed 20 until a steady speed above 25 is reached. With gas prices being what they are I'm trying very hard to maximize my MPG, so I find the around town mileage very disappointing. Freeway mileage is as good or better than EPA sticker estimates. I believe the transmission gearing could and should be modified to accommodate the lack of horsepower, and the lack of horsepower and poor MPG experience are honestly my only complaints. The interior is design and seating are sweet, the ride even and the handling are sweeter yet. Overall, I give my CX-5 Carbon Edition is solid 4 ...and I've owned many cars, including BMW and MB."
"Fun to drive, intuitive tech, USB in the rear"
"Tiny cargo area, poor attention to finish"
"I purchased this car in July 2021 and promptly drove it all over the place due to a family emergency. 

Pros: 
- Gas mileage isn’t terrible (but I came out of a 2008 4Runner 4WD with a V8, for perspective!) 
- The Bose sound system, sunroof and power lift gate are totally worth it 
- The Mazda app is brilliant - I get text messages from my car reminding me to lock it or close doors, etc. I refer to it as the app making the hands free lock/unlock/start system stupid proof :)
- The paint is distinctive, which makes it easy to find in a sea of crossovers 
- The black wheels are beauties 
- The AWD performs beautifully in both severe rain and 10”+ of unplowed snow
- I personally like the entertainment system - it’s intuitive with a little practice and reminds me of the days of T9 texting where I could compose text messages flawlessly without ever looking down. I appreciate never taking my eyes off of the road 
- I like that Bluetooth automatically connects so I can listen to audio without ever taking my phone out of my purse 
- The CarPlay is great for using my phone’s GPS and switching between audio on the fly 
- The hands free calling supposedly sounds great, even with the windows down 

Cons: 
- I don’t like the finish; carpets end just out of sight, rather than completely covering the vehicle’s interior (like under seats and below gas pedals) - it feels cheap and half-hearted. 
- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
Everything
The small exhaust tips
"I can’t say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I’ve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."
Sharp driving experience
Bose only on highest trim levels
"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"

- The glossy/shiny elements scratch if you look at them sideways (forget if you touch them with anything having even the slightest edge) - I accidentally scuffed mine the first time I vacuumed the interior and was super angry  
- the plastic pieces on the exterior (like around the wheel wells) are easily loosened by vibrations which makes me think they’re cheaply made/installed 
- my dealer reported that the tires are known for “cupping” (at least here in the mountains) and they need to be rotated more frequently than the factory suggests or the tires will wear out very quickly (and unevenly) 
- The engine felt like it struggled with pickup and shifting gears after 10k miles or so (but to be fair, I was used to a V8; my perspective may be a little skewed)  
- My 2008 4Runner with 4WD and a V8 had a much quieter interior than this car, even with that old truck having 264k miles on it - the road noise is disappointing in a vehicle that’s sold as being in competition with luxury brands
- the trunk space is minuscule - my two 50ish pound dogs can barely lay down if the rear seats are up - again, I came out of a 4Runner, so my perspective may be skewed

I liked this vehicle enough to trade it in for a 2022 PP CX-5, since I could start over with zero miles and my payment really didn’t change. The 2022 Carbons seem difficult to find, are priced at more of a premium than 2021’s were, and all of the 2022 Carbons I’ve seen lack the Bose."
Sporty interior and exterior. Options
A little underpowered
I bought the Carbon Edition. Love the red leather interior and all the options it came with. Sporty interior and exterior. It is the first import that I have bought. Happy with it so far. A little under powered but it does have a sport mode to offset that. Other than that I am happy.
Fun and easy to drive. No wandering on highways.
Fuel EPA needs improvement. Cargo area tight.
"Over the years I've owned Lincoln, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mazda and BMW cars.  This CX5 is the best car I've owned so far.  No major repairs needed in 5 years so far. Where as most other cars listed did fail in less time and needed numerous repairs and service.  With an exception; the Mitsubishi (Plymouth Arrow) and Mazda RX7 had excellent service history.
The CX5 is very dependable fun to drive easy to control on interstate highways. I would recommend."
Everything
The small exhaust tips
"I can’t say enough good things, responsive, fast, sleek, quiet and spacious. I’ve added larger exhaust tips, changed the turn signals to LED, added a wireless charger, etc."
"Just bought the 2022 Mazda CX-5 Signature. Went from a Ram Longhorn to the Mazda. Different season of life. Love the look and feel of the CX-5. Comfortable with a great interior and the driving experience is great. Feels like a sports car. Did extensive research before purchase and got it right. A little tight in the trunk space but two or even three golf bags fit, so I’m good to go. It’s a great car."
Sharp driving experience
Bose only on highest trim levels
"This vehicle has presence . When you look at , it is balanced and looks great from all angles . Once inside , it honestly reminds me of the Porsche Cayenne / and others ( as I sold them for a few years ) The stitching and well thought out transitions on the dash layout are clean , tight and impressive . It comes off as a vehicle 2x the price .This year it has new seats and they are great . Spent hours in the saddle and spot on support , lumbar , and able to find a  position that gives me confidence in my ability to see all around . Smooth , crisp steering thats perfectly weighted with just the proper amount of understeer . Hey its a Mazda and driving enjoyment is priority #1 / and the new 2022 / they nailed it ! The transmission is 6sp and just effortlessly flips through every gear as if it knows what you need . Just silky imput combined with very sennsitive throttle response - I mean super sensitive ! It took me 3000 miles to learn how to manipulate the engine / trans synergy as its that touchy - I was driving my old 2010 Mazda 3 GT Hb - 2.5 - which is still tight as day 1 with 145k on it - sprung like an indy car - so the CX-5 threw me off -  why - Well its not a stripped go cart like my 3 but it has clearly moved into another realm . With the only 13/1 compression ratio engine Ive seen in any suv - that translates to super high conpression and feedback - which I mistook for being jumpy , or bucking when i let of the gas - no it was me ! I needed to learn to drive this ultra precision instrument - a scalpel of an suv - and once we got together on pressures and imput , its a symphony -I didnt want a hybrid as the mileage can go up to 35 fwy on this guy with awd !  But the other reason I wanted this CX-5 , is Ive been around and had many new cars - and realize that times are changing . To find a real gerabox ( NOT A CVT ) and a high compression gas combustion only driveline with it ...is rare and almost gone , Mazda has taken the true auto gearbox to its highedt level with the skyactive awd trans , and done the same with a phenomonally tuned naturally aspirated high compression 4 thats got great real world torque from very low rpms , where , lets be honest , we do most of our driving in todays world . You want more hp , go with turbo ( which drops the compresson ) - but I didnt - I just wanted old school stuff taken to the highest of the high level - and Mazda delivered - 100% statisfied !
Carbon edition here - red leather - only complaint  , no bose on CE trim -but - Its ok - I know its a Mazda as Ive had many and they all have the same attributes,  You feel like you never want to stop driving or when home , want to go drive again , and they feel hand built - not like any other cars on the market - and I have driven them all - or dang near close - Mazda gets one thing , they dont rely on dropping a huge amount of horsepower to trick you into liking the car. ~ no / They build a car thats well rounded, precision , that sneaks up on you after you own it and then one day , go , ah ha ..I get it -  The miata is a very good example of the same principle they use in all their cars - its under 200 hp but one of the top 10 sports cars in the world , year after year after year ?  - Why is that ? Theres so many sports cars with tons more power ...so why ? Its because its about the balance of all things that the car is - combined to be and act as something that feels like one beautifully well rounded instrument of driving joy - This CX-5 is that and as well the finest Cx-5 to date.
If you dont want a hydrid , this may be the last year to get one without - 
Love the 19"" wheels and blacked out rims on CE edition - 
I think the CX-5 is #1 in its class ( small suv ) but the "" expert "" reviewers are taking PR $$ from other companies to get their new whatever as "" best "" in class -  ok , ok ,  The CX-5 is not huge inside , good its only my wife and I , and its a bit "" firm "" in the suspension for gramma /. yeah yeah - good , spring it tighter ! , these are just excuses - Do you want an suv that was just "" redesigned "" or that gets best because its first year and the engineers made sure they took every caragory and made it 1/2"" bigger or has 12 more hp or 5 more cu ft of cargo space .?  You see my point - these other suvs are competing with each other - MAZDA is in a class by itself and they built it to be the way it is for a reason - not to beat kia or the rav 4 in cargo space or price or 3 extra hp - MAZDA builds the cars to be great in thier own right - If you are a bean counter / stay the heck away from the Mazda family - these cars have souls - 
Last note - not unlike the porsche 911 - the CX-5 is coming up on 10 years I believe - and MAZDA has taken the same car each year and worked the kinks out of it , making it better snd better and better - this means it looks only slightly different , but has been engineered to be more reliable and more refined each year -  It gets knocked by critics because its not newly fully redesigned -   well this may be the last year of the same design before a big change - So do you want a first year car that might have issues or recalls , or a car thats been continually improved over years and years ??  Not for everyone - but definitly for me - Also , worth a second mention , most suvs in this catagory have CVT transmissions -  Continuously Variable Transmission -   in other words , it does not have stepped gears , its like stepping on a sponge , not crisp and they try to trick you with CVTs saying you can use it like a regular transmission -  bs /. they are just cheaper to build and dont last as long - plus they just dont deliver a great experience /.  Ask when comparing , or look at what type of transmission the suv you are looking at has - Then look at the cross section of a Skysctive Mazda transmission -  nothing cheap about it !"
Drives like a sports car
Conservative space behind the back seat
"While they try to ram electric cars down our throats, it’s gratifying to know that there is still a company that builds a real car. This car is amazing and the tech is fantastic. I ordered the NAV chip from Amazon. Don’t. A simple usb cable allows you to project your phone on the 10.4” display.
I got the select version which is just above the base. I got leather seats, AWD, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, heated seats, dual climate controls up front and leather wrapped steered no wheel and shifter all standard. 
The styling is excellent, the interior reminds me of an Acura or a Lexus, and the car is definitely a drivers car. It handles beautifully and I am one of those people that hate CVT transmissions, so I love that Mazda gives you a REAL 6 speed automatic with sport mode. I got the non-turbo version because with the turbo, I wouldn’t have the self discipline not to thrash it every chance I got…and would probably start accumulating tickets as a result. Besides, I plan on having this car for a long time and turbochargers generally shorten the engine lifespan. 
About the only mod I decided on was the all weather floor mats…not weather-tech, but the custom leather measured ones for about half the price.
Alloy wheels come standard. The car even sends me text messages if I forget to lock the doors. Also I love the auto start feature that lets me warm my car up on cold mornings.
About the only criticism I have for the car is that the space behind the rear seat is not generous, but that is by design, not accident. A longer vehicle wouldn’t handle as brilliantly as this one does. No, I never plan to take it off road but for Chicago winters, it performs flawlessly.  I am getting about 26 mpg which I am happy with and the headlights are the brightest I have ever had. 
If you want a vehicle to haul lots of stuff, the RAV4 or CRV would probably be a better fit. But if you want a real drivers car that makes very few compromises, has tons of standard features, safety tech like crazy, standard AWD and something you would be proud of every time you get to drive it, the CX-5 is the compact SUV for you as it was for me!"
Everything!
Nothing
I absolutely love this crossover!!! It’s definitely the best in class for a reason or many. The handling & ride is like an even higher class vehicle. Excellent & super happy w my smart decision!
Fun to Drive definitely
Interior space
"I took the base model, and I’m fully satisfied with the decision.
Though it’s the base version standard AWD and safety features included are top notch.

Interior is very quiet.
Suspension is very good."
"Fun to drive, stylish, good car in snow"
"Paint seems to chip easier, and less trunk space"
"This car does great in the snow! It’s comfortable, reliable, stylish and overall a car I would drive for years to come. Love the leather interior and sunroof on the preferred package! Not a bad price for all the luxury that comes with it."
Fun to Drive
Excessive oil consumption
"We've owned numerous Mazdas.  All good!  This SUV is great as well.  Unfortunately there is a known oil consumption issue due to redesigned oil value seals creating excessive oil usage between oil changes.  (a quart) My dealer recommends keeping quarts of oil in the suv at all times.  This can begin at as low as 2000 miles.  Mazda is aware of it, but there is no known fix for the problem at this time.  A TSB has been issued.  This is in ALL 2021 Mazda's with the turbo engine.  My 2021 CX5 has 5400 miles, no known issues, but its just a matter of time.  Ive decided to trade mine in for a 22 with the non turbo engine.  My wife's 2015 has had 101,000 trouble free miles.  Beware. I was not aware of the issue when I bought it."
"Fun to drive, cheap on gas, looks great , reliable"
Compact suv
Although the interior has less bells and whistles then a CX-9 and is smaller it still has the perfect sporty feel. Not intimidating or pompous in what it can do but reliable in all spec’s. The engine alone has amazing speed and the turbo equally rivals some other competitors. The carbon edition has a slight flare to the interior that makes it unique. The backseat although more compact then other suv doesn’t take away from the overall experience. For a two family vehicle it’s perfect and the trunk space easily fits 4 60L hiking packs or with seats down two bikes. I love my turbo and I have never spent more then $37 to fill it up from empty.
