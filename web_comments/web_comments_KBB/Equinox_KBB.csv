terrible ride
"The seat heater only has one switch for back rest and seat, seat gets hot back does not. On*star cannot store phone numbers. Most terrible ride of any car I ever own. Auto stop is Irritating."
Nice ride
Honestly can’t think of any
It’s a nice looking car . Handles great in snow and ice . Good gas mileage. Trade in value after a year is more than I paid for the vehicle. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it. I feel she’s in a very safe vehicle.
Love the mileage at 29 mpg average.
Road noisy inside.

"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere. The drive handles amazing whether you're having to do sharp turns, keep on your lane at 80 miles, or going on an off-road trail. Overall I give my chevy equinox a 10/10."
Has lots of storage!
"No CD player, had multiple problems"

"This is my third Equinox, and is probably the best!  It's a Premier, so it has many extra features.
Although I miss my CD player, with Sirrius and Pandora, I can receive beautiful music through a fine audio system.  Prior to purchasing, I drove numerous small to medium size SUVs, however, most
did not feel as solid as the Equinox.  Several were smaller and lighter, however with the number of miles I drive, I wanted the feeling of a comfortable and substantial vehicle, which could travel on ice and snow, get reasonably good gas mileage.  Those which were similar in ride and comfort were far more expensive."

"Purchased with 5 miles on the car. Since the beginning I've  had 3 issues, electrical glitch with blindside warning coming on and not able to adjust the radio with the steering wheel controls.
The AWD warning for system issues. Finally the vehicle in the dealership for a month having the the axels replaced at 3K miles. GM doesn't care about the quality of their vehicles  or the inconvenience to their customers. I have bought 4 new GM products in 5 years and never will again."
"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.) We also travel for hockey... 2 hockey bags in the back?... forget it. Only one is going to fit, unless you have someone in the back seat holding the second hockey bag so the back door shuts. You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."

You then can't see out your back window.. Hockey sticks... i don't know how we fit those in as well... someone is usually getting hit in the head with one. The side view mirrors are stupid small. The bucket seats are okay in the front... but if you're a little bigger like myself it can be uncomfortable with the back fat rolls. The auto head lights are nice, but they also go back and fourth from seeing a reflection off a stop sign/speed sign. The auto stop.... you can actually shut that off, which is really really nice!! The pull down sun shades.. SUPER SHORT and doesn't block out any sun off your face unless you're a tall person with your head almost touching the top of the car. The Bluetooth.. i have my phone connected as the main phone, but every time my son or husband gets in, it connects all three of ours? GPS... you can't use it unless you pay for OnStar or whatever it is.. My old car used to read my text messages for me when i'm driving.. this one does not... that really sucks. 12 gallon tank.. really sucks."
"I have the Equinox 1LT, sticker price 29,745 (approx).
  I am extremely happy with the driving of this vehicle, much better than expert reviews detail. MPG for my 1.5 front wheel drive is 31.7 over approx 3200 miles. Very satisfied with this. Plenty of power for me, I am not a speed demon and want good MPG vs Power. Excellent set up with the 2018 Equinox w/ 1.5 liter.
  Interior is very nice, drives great. I-phone connection works great. Could be a better GPS set up. 
  Recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for moderate priced, good looking, great driving, well built driving machine.
  My best to you."
"I  owned a 2016, equinox and it was under a lease, i should have kept it, i loved that vehicle, but I went and gave it back and purchased a 2019, well it was the worst mistake of my life, I hate this new one, it doesn't have it own design, it looks like all the other smaller SUV's from other Manufacturers, but to keep it short, the only things I like about this vehicle is the All Wheel Drive, gas mileage, BlueTooth"

"I love my Equinox but at 17,000 miles the GM service dept told me I needed new tires.  I was very upset. After having to make several phone calls to them they finally said they would give me 2 new tires and I would have to buy the other two. Other than the tires I really liked it."

terrible ride
"The seat heater only has one switch for back rest and seat, seat gets hot back does not. On*star cannot store phone numbers. Most terrible ride of any car I ever own. Auto stop is Irritating."
Nice ride
Honestly can’t think of any
It’s a nice looking car . Handles great in snow and ice . Good gas mileage. Trade in value after a year is more than I paid for the vehicle. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it. I feel she’s in a very safe vehicle.
Love the mileage at 29 mpg average.
Road noisy inside.
"My back tires were completely bald at 29,552 miles. In my
opinion they put cheap tires on them from factory and they don’t last."

"I got my 2020 chevy equinox LS turbocharge at the end of 2019. I first got to experience a chevy equinox as a rental. It was a 2019 AWD. So I instinctively wanted on as my own. The inside is a simple look grey sits, radio, a simple drive panel. It is big enough to have 4 passengers fit comfortably. The back seat folds down which was ideal when I went camping. It has a quiet motor sound, but it will roar when you need to accelerate on a 80 mile highway. Great milage per gallon I have average about 23 miles per gallon. I have a white color and it looks so nice and it just fits right everywhere. The drive handles amazing whether you're having to do sharp turns, keep on your lane at 80 miles, or going on an off-road trail. Overall I give my chevy equinox a 10/10."
Has lots of storage!
"No CD player, had multiple problems"
"15,000 thousands miles, axle had to be replaced! Definitely can't have back windows down, will vibrate your ears!"
"Comfortable, safe, and economic"
Not enough color choices--mostly black or black!
"This is my third Equinox, and is probably the best!  It's a Premier, so it has many extra features.
Although I miss my CD player, with Sirrius and Pandora, I can receive beautiful music through a fine audio system.  Prior to purchasing, I drove numerous small to medium size SUVs, however, most
did not feel as solid as the Equinox.  Several were smaller and lighter, however with the number of miles I drive, I wanted the feeling of a comfortable and substantial vehicle, which could travel on ice and snow, get reasonably good gas mileage.  Those which were similar in ride and comfort were far more expensive."

Quality and lack of support from GM on issues.
"Purchased with 5 miles on the car. Since the beginning I've  had 3 issues, electrical glitch with blindside warning coming on and not able to adjust the radio with the steering wheel controls.
The AWD warning for system issues. Finally the vehicle in the dealership for a month having the the axels replaced at 3K miles. GM doesn't care about the quality of their vehicles  or the inconvenience to their customers. I have bought 4 new GM products in 5 years and never will again."
"Made this post on 11/10/2021.... Update to that post... my car is STILL in the shop. Today is 12/7/201. Tech just called back stating it was my transmission.  :(  Still not sure of why the blind spot keeps coming on when nothing is there. Totally wish i never got this car. 


We just purchased the 2022. Drove it off the lot with 30 miles on it. Two days after we drove it off the lot, we noticed the driver side blind spot light kept coming on when nothing was on the side of the car.. brought it to the dealership, and they said nothing was wrong with it, they drove it down the road, didn't see a light come on and they couldn't pull any codes. As soon as i drove it away the stupid light came on again, and still 2 months later coming on and off with no reason. Two nights ago i got off the interstate and the car started making this loud noise coming from the engine/trani. Never a noise that i have ever heard in my life. Had barley any power. I came to a stop light and went to go and it started bucking. I barley made it home. Tow truck had to come get it and it's now sitting at the dealership waiting to get looked at. The back seat is super super small. We have three kiddos and between the car seat for my 3 year old, our 12 year old, and 7 year old there is no room at all! My two older kids are having all they can do to not sit basically on top of each other. (maybe being a tad bit dramatic, but it's wicked small.)
