"I owned a 2011 Rogue and had zero problems with it, but when it came time to purchase a new car, I wanted something different.  I felt so strongly that I literally didn’t even look at the Rogue during my research. I read many websites and everyone rated the Honda CR V in their top 3, while I haven’t seen the Rogue get any higher than 4th. So, I test drove the Honda CR V.  I was satisfied but not excited.  I left the dealership saying to myself, “SUVs are just not that exciting.” I was all set to go back and purchase it but I decided to look at the Nissan Rogue on the Nissan website. I loved the new look! The next day I went to test drive it and left only after I purchased it!  I was in love as soon as I saw it on the showroom floor. Sitting in it made me feel secure and even fancy! It’s comfortable, but it’s also well designed.  The front row storage is plentiful, convenient, and innovative. The backseat is comfortable and the a/c cents to the back are awesome. (My 2011 didn’t have those.)  The cargo space is similar to my 2011. The safety features are plentiful but overwhelming; note, however, that they would be overwhelming in any car I bought because I’ve never owned a vehicle that had any of those features. 

I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. I’m excited to drive it, though, and for me that was shocking. Even my 2011 when it was new didn’t feel exciting exactly. I only hope that this Rogue holds up as well as my other one. 

I firmly believe this vehicle belongs higher up on the lists."

"Just got the car but wanted to share my experience so far. This is my first new car purchase. I have the SV trim. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Corolla, so this has been a big upgrade. I am not all that concerned with power and performance as a driver, but I wanted AWD with a decent MPG. I am a tall woman and I have no issues with legspace. Comfort, visibility, safety features, technology/infotainment, A/C are all great. 

Gas mileage is very good because I drive in ECO mode all the time. I am getting 31 on the highway with the A/C on. Around 27 average city type driving (stop signs and traffic lights).

I love the infotainment. I use Android Auto with Waze, and the Sirius XM app through the phone to access additional music channels that the factory provided Sirius XM does not have. Also I have the Amazon Music app, which works great through the bluetooth.

There is free remote start, but you have to be physically close to the car for it to work, unless you continue the NissonConnect app subsciption which becomes 9-10 dollars/month after a short trial period.

I may add heated seats before next winter, but I am not used to having them so we'll see.

Its a bit early to rate reliability and value."

Had few months and few options to decide on a car before I went with Rogue. Platinum model has all the bells and whistles you would want in a crossover. It has the best interiors and quietist interior cabin compared with CRV and Rav4. Seats are great and amazing for long distance drives. Ride quality is fine for this class and has the best Gauge cluster screen.

"Complaints about the 2021 Nissan Rogue SV. Purchased 7-21-2021
I have almost 14,000 miles in this thing and wish I never purchased it. 

1.	The air condition system has a mind of its own. The dual personality is present wither the car has just been started or has been running a while. One side seems to blow the selected temperature. This is the passenger side of the vehicle. The other side, the driver’s side, wants to blow hot air all the time. If the temperature outside is say 80 and I want 72 in the car, the passenger side will cool down no problem BUT the driver’s side will blow hot, not warm but hot air. Seeing how the human body falls asleep in warm temperatures, I see this is a big safety problem.  In the colder months, when I want just a little bit of warm air, the same occurs, it will blow hot air, not slightly warm air like I want. 

2.	The cruise control and steering assist system have no idea what it means to gradually slow down or what to do on a slight hill approach. It also watches the vehicle in the right adjacent lane too much. For instance, on a 3-lane road, I will be driving the speed set on the cruise control but if a car in the right lane exits the highway, the car will brake like the vehicle is directly in front of it. It seems like a safety issue when the traffic behind me sees me slowing down for no reason at all. The cruise control also thinks an approaching hill is a car and will perform an emergency braking maneuver when all that is happening is that the vehicle is approaching an uphill grade.

3.	The third strike against this car is the FACT that the “infotainment system” has serious flaws. When putting the car in reverse, I expect the reverse camera to come on and have priority over all other infotainment systems. What happens is that I am in a parking lot and I need the camera to give me an overhead look so I pish the “camera” button on the infotainment system panel. No problem most times if I am doing under .005 mph. IF I am in the camera views where I get the forward-facing camera and an overhead view and hit the camera button once more for the front right tire view to assist me in parking, it will not switch views. It will just stay in the front camera overhead view screens. IF I place the vehicle in reverse while in this view, it will not change to the backup camera at all. It is just locked up. 

4.	When I received the vehicle from the dealership, I noticed an “off” type sound when I closed the rear drivers side door. It was not the usual soft thud from closing a well aligned door. It had more of a misaligned sound like it was nit lined up properly and striking something the wrong way. I mentioned this to the sales man but he just blew it off. Over time this has gotten more prevalent. I fear over time this will become like a truck from the 70’s where it sounds like closing an old door weighing 300 pounds against a metal pipe."
"Favorites:
1. Zero gravity seats.  No more aching behind or restricted blood flow on longer rides.  I wish my apt was full of these.
2. Panoramic sunroof.  Lots of light.  it's huge.
3. Interior.  so sophisticated from the mini shifter embedded in scratched woodish materials.  The leather wrapped steering wheqQd"
Love the look & red color ( which costs more).
"Touch screen, too complicated , shifter bad design"
"I purchased this car 4 months ago and have had No Mechanical Problems. What I don’t like is that there are way too many bell’s & whistles. It has taken me several months to turn off the warning buzzers & alerts. I really dislike not being able to shift into park when you stop…everything is all electronic. The touch screen info system is often unresponsive which makes a change difficult when driving. There is a LOT of wind/ road noise T 60mph. At 1,000 rpm the steering wheel vibrates. The dealer said it is “normal”.  Just not satisfied for $31,000."
Great safety features and style
Suspension and quality control.
"traded my 2018 Rouge in for the new 2021. BIG Mistake!  Worst suspension in a vehicle I have ever owned. One little bump and this things goes into a tizzy. A/C wont adjust, air vent on passenger side not working. I like the look of the new Rouge and it does have nice features but my 2018 rouge had more features than this and the ride was 90% better. It's a lease and the bright side is I can't dump this thing back on the dealers lot in three years. Time for a brand change I think."

"I purchased the SV model with a sticker price of $29,500. The interior is very attractive.  While this model does not have all the 'bells & whistles' of the more expensive SUVs, it is nicely equipped.  Great safety features.  The ride is smooth for a mid priced SUV and comfortable to drive.  If you looking for an affordable SUV, this one is for you.  Only have driven the SUV for a few weeks so no issues yet.  Friends of mine are on their 2nd Rogue and they loved both."

"I purchased this car 4 months ago and have had No Mechanical Problems. What I don’t like is that there are way too many bell’s & whistles. It has taken me several months to turn off the warning buzzers & alerts. I really dislike not being able to shift into park when you stop…everything is all electronic. The touch screen info system is often unresponsive which makes a change difficult when driving. There is a LOT of wind/ road noise T 60mph. At 1,000 rpm the steering wheel vibrates. The dealer said it is “normal”.  Just not satisfied for $31,000."
Great safety features and style
Suspension and quality control.
"traded my 2018 Rouge in for the new 2021. BIG Mistake!  Worst suspension in a vehicle I have ever owned. One little bump and this things goes into a tizzy. A/C wont adjust, air vent on passenger side not working. I like the look of the new Rouge and it does have nice features but my 2018 rouge had more features than this and the ride was 90% better. It's a lease and the bright side is I can't dump this thing back on the dealers lot in three years. Time for a brand change I think."
Nicely equipped for the price

"I purchased the SV model with a sticker price of $29,500. The interior is very attractive.  While this model does not have all the 'bells & whistles' of the more expensive SUVs, it is nicely equipped.  Great safety features.  The ride is smooth for a mid priced SUV and comfortable to drive.  If you looking for an affordable SUV, this one is for you.  Only have driven the SUV for a few weeks so no issues yet.  Friends of mine are on their 2nd Rogue and they loved both."
Good mix
Not much
"No complaints, does what it should and hasn't complained. Nice touch screen and speakers standard, check it out"
