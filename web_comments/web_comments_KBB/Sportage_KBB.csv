"Test drove the , CR-V, CX-9, VW Alltrack & Touareg , Tucson, Outback, Rouge, Escape & Rav4. The KIA Sportage SX was the best combination of quality, power and handling. This vehicle is just so fun to drive!
Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode.

It's a great vehicle but the Kia customer service is extremely poor on all levels.

Drives great
Seats could be more comfortable
"This is a great little car, rides great and in my opinion very cute&sporty. I have visited family afew hours away and it drove great. Never any problems. Will be trading her in soon for a newer model, but will be sticking with the Sportage. It’s roomy and fun to drive. The only complaint I would have is the seats could be a bit more comfortable,  other than that I love her =)"
It is a lot of fun to drive
The engine is not noise at all
"This is one of the best car I ever had, a great space at the truck, the seats are very conforables
and the car stability is great."
Fun to drive. Responsive
Doesn't have Adaptive cruise control.
"Very comfortable seats, especially in the mountains. Quiet. No engin noise. Solid feel, especially on the highway.  Good gas mileage with economy mode. Rear seats recline.  Nice feature on a road trip. Info system is good. Turn by turn navigation,  hands free phone is great."
Runs smooth and pretty good gas mileage
Little noisy but like it otherwise
"Would defintely buy This SUV again.
Great SUV. Bought it in 2017 and no problems at all.
Inside interior looks new."
"Handles curves,all wheel in rain is great."
"NO quiet ride,seating narrow,enter/exit no ease"
"Door handles on exterior are made with the cheapest thin plastic. Cargo area has very thin plastic that if a can of paint rolls it will crack the cheap thin plastic. 
Never should have wasted my money on the exterior protection which is absolutely ridiculous with exclusions.  I do not advise anyone to purchase this exterior protection.  It’s COSTLY and the company of product doesn’t stand by product where I am concerned. Dealerships get a big kick back for selling."

Wind noise at highway speeds
"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features."
This vehicle feels sporty to drive in sports mode
not as quiet as a cadillac but not bad
"Don't get me wrong, 99 percent of people will probably find this car comfortable enough for them but at 6-3 and 300 Lb's its a little too cramped. The car has plenty of power and is surprisingly nimble considering it is not a sports car. The turbo edition is definitely  worth the extra money as is the all wheel drive. The AWD makes it handle really well when we get those huge rains here in Florida."
"handling, comfort, quiet, options, fit and finish"
wish gas tank was bigger
"have owned this sportage for about 6 months now, absolutely love everything about it . have gotten 33 mpg on hwy , great !"
Fun to drive
Heating system
This car is great except for there is no cd player and no way to turn the heat/air completely off which makes for a very uncomfortable ride.  Have to have either heat or air on at all times.  Sunroof does not allow any air to come in unless you have it all the way open.  Without the heat/air and no cd player the car could score all 5's.
"Excellent leg and head room, I am 6' 3"" tall, Impressive acceleration. cruises effortlessly at high speed , very little wind noise and gets good gas mileage. Have not required 1 trip to the shop for any repair etc."
Great looking SUV
"Very reliable, comfortable to drive.  Feels smooth, like driving a car, but has the extra space advantage an SUV.  Handles well in all kinds of weather."
"Fun, cute, good handling, roomy"
Thieves like it too
"Love my Sportage! She's perfect in the snow, heading up to the mountains for camping trips, fits multiple grown 6 feet tall adult men with room to spare. 
I love all the different driving modes, the headlights. It is incredibly comfortable and the 'driver-centric design makes you feel like you're driving a sports car.
My one gripe about this car is it is notoriously easy to steal. 
I didn't realize it until mine was stolen last week and I googled 'Kia Sportage thefts' - the stories about people who had theirs stolen were endless. 
Kia (and Hyundai) are quickly climbing up the ranks as one of the most stolen car brands due to the key fob and ignition issues. 
Buy the car, but negotiate for an aftermarket alarm & GPS or be prepared to purchase your own!"
Easy to drive and it looks good.
The recalls were a concern. Dealership fixed it.
"I love my 2018 Kia Sportage !!  I have taken it on a few road trips and it has not disappointed !
The ride is smooth, very comfortable and the gas mileage was fair. I reall like this car."
"Quiet , comfortable, handles well"
Cargo space could be larger
I like the vehicles looks but was amazed at the ride and comfort on my test drive. This vehicle is appears to be a great value for someone like myself that does not want to pay a premium for a premium vehicle. The Sportage show great sporty character on the exterior and has a upgrade look at the interior even in the base model.
"Fun to drive, and feels luxurious."
"Hard front seats, no memory on seats/mirrors"
"Smooth and quiet, and feels like quality. Not like the old pre-2010 Kias. Uses soft materials and good technology to enhance the drivers experience. 2.0L turbo will get up and scoot! daily driven around town and taken on 4 longer trips (1200+ miles). Still feels new! Love the sunroof, but don't use it as much as I thought I would. Front seats are a bit hard, and take some adjusting to get used to, but the heated/cooled portion works well. This car feels like a car that costs thousands more. Gets an easy 27mpg at highway speeds with full passengers. The only thing I would add is a seat/mirror memory option, so that it is easily returned to its settings after my wife uses the car. A car of this class should have that option. Otherwise love it."

"Smooth and quiet, and feels like quality. Not like the old pre-2010 Kias. Uses soft materials and good technology to enhance the drivers experience. 2.0L turbo will get up and scoot! daily driven around town and taken on 4 longer trips (1200+ miles). Still feels new! Love the sunroof, but don't use it as much as I thought I would. Front seats are a bit hard, and take some adjusting to get used to, but the heated/cooled portion works well. This car feels like a car that costs thousands more. Gets an easy 27mpg at highway speeds with full passengers. The only thing I would add is a seat/mirror memory option, so that it is easily returned to its settings after my wife uses the car. A car of this class should have that option. Otherwise love it."
"Test drove the , CR-V, CX-9, VW Alltrack & Touareg , Tucson, Outback, Rouge, Escape & Rav4. The KIA Sportage SX was the best combination of quality, power and handling. This vehicle is just so fun to drive!
Interior fit and finish is as good as the Honda. The handling was on par with the VW Alltrack and acceleration beat the CX-5. The KIA came with some options not available on any of these (like cooled vented front seats) and priced (with all those options) at or better than the competition.
 
My biggest concern was the listed mileage numbers: City 20/Hwy 23/Comb 21 MPG with the 240Hp turbo.  But on my first vacation trip (about 550 miles) I averaged 30.5 MPG by just setting my cruise control at 77 mph and running in Eco mode. My highway numbers since then are still around 26-27 mpg on shorter trips.

Buying a KIA was not in my plans when I started my shopping process but all those test drives opened my eyes, KIA has really stepped up its game!"
It's a great vehicle but the Kia customer service is extremely poor on all levels.

Drives great
Seats could be more comfortable
"This is a great little car, rides great and in my opinion very cute&sporty. I have visited family afew hours away and it drove great. Never any problems. Will be trading her in soon for a newer model, but will be sticking with the Sportage. It’s roomy and fun to drive. The only complaint I would have is the seats could be a bit more comfortable,  other than that I love her =)"
It is a lot of fun to drive
The engine is not noise at all
"This is one of the best car I ever had, a great space at the truck, the seats are very conforables
and the car stability is great."
Fun to drive. Responsive
Doesn't have Adaptive cruise control.
"Very comfortable seats, especially in the mountains. Quiet. No engin noise. Solid feel, especially on the highway.  Good gas mileage with economy mode. Rear seats recline.  Nice feature on a road trip. Info system is good. Turn by turn navigation,  hands free phone is great."
Runs smooth and pretty good gas mileage
Little noisy but like it otherwise
"Would defintely buy This SUV again.
Great SUV. Bought it in 2017 and no problems at all.
Inside interior looks new."
"Handles curves,all wheel in rain is great."
"NO quiet ride,seating narrow,enter/exit no ease"
"Door handles on exterior are made with the cheapest thin plastic. Cargo area has very thin plastic that if a can of paint rolls it will crack the cheap thin plastic. 
Never should have wasted my money on the exterior protection which is absolutely ridiculous with exclusions.  I do not advise anyone to purchase this exterior protection.  It’s COSTLY and the company of product doesn’t stand by product where I am concerned. Dealerships get a big kick back for selling."

Wind noise at highway speeds
"SX-T GDI AWD model.

I bought this used end of June '21 with 75,000 miles on it. So far, it's been fantastic. Hands down the best car I've had so far, including my previous favorite, an '03 Mazda6s I bought new in '02.

If I drive it ""right"", I can get 25MPG on the highway, higher than the EPA sticker. If I drive it my way, less.  Haven't yet had a chance to use it in the snow. I dinged the value because of the fuel economy, and style because I'm not fond of the sunroof nor the roof rails. In fact, I think the roof rails may be the cause of the wind noise at highway speeds.

With the DCT and the paddle shifters plus the turbo, when I want this thing to go, it goes. And it turns on a dime. Well, maybe a nickel. Point there is that it has a tighter turning radius than you'd think, and with speed-sensitive variable power assist to make it easier to turn at low speeds and more stable at higher speeds. 

I normally drive alone, once I was driving some friends around, totaling three adults and two teenagers and there was zero difference in how the car handled. It was not in any way sluggish in anything compared to just me in there.

The leather seats are well cushioned, not too little and not too much, both front ones are power adjust, and both front seats are also heated and vented and the steering wheel is heated. Wish the outside mirrors had defrosters, but they don't. Lots of safety features."
This vehicle feels sporty to drive in sports mode
not as quiet as a cadillac but not bad
"Don't get me wrong, 99 percent of people will probably find this car comfortable enough for them but at 6-3 and 300 Lb's its a little too cramped. The car has plenty of power and is surprisingly nimble considering it is not a sports car. The turbo edition is definitely  worth the extra money as is the all wheel drive. The AWD makes it handle really well when we get those huge rains here in Florida."
"handling, comfort, quiet, options, fit and finish"
wish gas tank was bigger
"have owned this sportage for about 6 months now, absolutely love everything about it . have gotten 33 mpg on hwy , great !"
Fun to drive
Heating system
This car is great except for there is no cd player and no way to turn the heat/air completely off which makes for a very uncomfortable ride.  Have to have either heat or air on at all times.  Sunroof does not allow any air to come in unless you have it all the way open.  Without the heat/air and no cd player the car could score all 5's.
"Excellent leg and head room, I am 6' 3"" tall, Impressive acceleration. cruises effortlessly at high speed , very little wind noise and gets good gas mileage. Have not required 1 trip to the shop for any repair etc."
Great looking SUV
"Very reliable, comfortable to drive.  Feels smooth, like driving a car, but has the extra space advantage an SUV.  Handles well in all kinds of weather."
"Fun, cute, good handling, roomy"
Thieves like it too
"Love my Sportage! She's perfect in the snow, heading up to the mountains for camping trips, fits multiple grown 6 feet tall adult men with room to spare. 
I love all the different driving modes, the headlights. It is incredibly comfortable and the 'driver-centric design makes you feel like you're driving a sports car.
My one gripe about this car is it is notoriously easy to steal. 
I didn't realize it until mine was stolen last week and I googled 'Kia Sportage thefts' - the stories about people who had theirs stolen were endless. 
Kia (and Hyundai) are quickly climbing up the ranks as one of the most stolen car brands due to the key fob and ignition issues. 
Buy the car, but negotiate for an aftermarket alarm & GPS or be prepared to purchase your own!"
Easy to drive and it looks good.
The recalls were a concern. Dealership fixed it.
"I love my 2018 Kia Sportage !!  I have taken it on a few road trips and it has not disappointed !
The ride is smooth, very comfortable and the gas mileage was fair. I reall like this car."
"Quiet , comfortable, handles well"
Cargo space could be larger
I like the vehicles looks but was amazed at the ride and comfort on my test drive. This vehicle is appears to be a great value for someone like myself that does not want to pay a premium for a premium vehicle. The Sportage show great sporty character on the exterior and has a upgrade look at the interior even in the base model.
