"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the “dual clutch transmission” (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  “safercar” web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."
Showing 15 of 100 reviews.
I still owe that much.  Value should be higher.  Could not sell for that. Hardly used at all.  Only owner is 80 years old
"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
None
Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Looks nice
Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"
Value
Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!
It’s a very luxurious car
Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn’t apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
"Utilitarian, practical"
"Wind noise, MPG"
"I own the 2021 Tucson. I’m really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don’t mind the plastic interior. It’s easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won’t feel like I’m treating it badly. I can’t see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It’s really about preference. I’ve owned a Hyundai before so I’m comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money."
Drive smoothly
No cons
Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.
"Fast and nimble, great gas mileage; 37 mpg highway"
Radio speakers are not good...
"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."
"Great driving experience, great gas mileage"
some road noise
"Very intuitive Car! Beautiful car styling and love the mohave sand color. Power everything, and the automatic lift hatchback is amazing. Everything about this car is smooth. Big car feel on the inside with midsize car handling abilities. Great features across the board. GREAT gas mileage. Super happy with my Tucson!"
Fun to drive
Design needs work
"The size is good, I just don't like the plain-looking hatch in the back. The weels and front end look ok. It could use some better performance driving"

But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money."
Drive smoothly
No cons
Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.
"Fast and nimble, great gas mileage; 37 mpg highway"
Radio speakers are not good...
"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."
"Great driving experience, great gas mileage"
some road noise
"Very intuitive Car! Beautiful car styling and love the mohave sand color. Power everything, and the automatic lift hatchback is amazing. Everything about this car is smooth. Big car feel on the inside with midsize car handling abilities. Great features across the board. GREAT gas mileage. Super happy with my Tucson!"
Fun to drive
Design needs work
"The size is good, I just don't like the plain-looking hatch in the back. The weels and front end look ok. It could use some better performance driving"
NICE LOOKING
NOT RELIABLE
THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the “dual clutch transmission” (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  “safercar” web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."
Showing 15 of 100 reviews.
I still owe that much.  Value should be higher.  Could not sell for that. Hardly used at all.  Only owner is 80 years old
"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
None
Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Looks nice
Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"
Value
Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!
It’s a very luxurious car
Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn’t apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
"Utilitarian, practical"
"Wind noise, MPG"
"I own the 2021 Tucson. I’m really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don’t mind the plastic interior. It’s easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won’t feel like I’m treating it badly. I can’t see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It’s really about preference. I’ve owned a Hyundai before so I’m comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money."

"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"
Value
Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!
It’s a very luxurious car
Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn’t apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
"Utilitarian, practical"
"Wind noise, MPG"
"I own the 2021 Tucson. I’m really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don’t mind the plastic interior. It’s easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won’t feel like I’m treating it badly. I can’t see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It’s really about preference. I’ve owned a Hyundai before so I’m comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money."
Drive smoothly
No cons
Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.
"Fast and nimble, great gas mileage; 37 mpg highway"
Radio speakers are not good...
"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."
"Great driving experience, great gas mileage"
some road noise
"Very intuitive Car! Beautiful car styling and love the mohave sand color. Power everything, and the automatic lift hatchback is amazing. Everything about this car is smooth. Big car feel on the inside with midsize car handling abilities. Great features across the board. GREAT gas mileage. Super happy with my Tucson!"
Fun to drive
Design needs work
"The size is good, I just don't like the plain-looking hatch in the back. The weels and front end look ok. It could use some better performance driving"
NICE LOOKING
NOT RELIABLE
THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the “dual clutch transmission” (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  “safercar” web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."
Showing 15 of 100 reviews.
I still owe that much.  Value should be higher.  Could not sell for that. Hardly used at all.  Only owner is 80 years old
"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
None
Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Looks nice
Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
"I purchased my 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited at the end of May 2016.  For about five weeks, I enjoyed the comfort, smooth ride, quiet cabin and features.  Unfortunately, after about five weeks, I had to have the vehicle towed to the local dealership because of problems with the “dual clutch transmission” (DCT).  It appears that I am not the only person experiencing problems with the DCT (the Eco, Sport and Limited models of the Tucson).   You should check out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  “safercar” web-site to see the over 100 complaints 2016 Tucson owners have reported about the DCT before you buy one for yourself."

I still owe that much.  Value should be higher.  Could not sell for that. Hardly used at all.  Only owner is 80 years old
"Quite, smooth ride, lots of room"
None
Perfect car for all purposes. One of the best cars and value I've ever owned. It is super quiet in the cabin with plenty of room for all passengers and lots of storage in the back . Factory warranty is one of the best in the business. I have had no problems with this car at all.
"I absolutely loved this car, except for all of the headaches that came with it.  The panoramic sunroof is fantastic, turbo engine WAS great and just overall look I really was a fan of.  However, its been nothing but repair after repair.  I get regular maintenance at the dealership, never miss an oil change and am completely up to date.  All of a sudden the engine failed.  I put a lot of miles on the but I was told ""something came loose in the engine"" which then destroyed the engine.  Because I have 108k miles and not 100k miles the warranty is no longer valid and the car is done.  Such a waste.  I can't tell you how ticked off this made me.  There have been numerous reported engine issues with this car and this was one of them.  I feel like I got robbed."
Looks nice
Faulty Engine - multiple recalls on previous years
"They have not fixed the engine issues that they've had previous recalls for. My timing belt tensioner and oil pump went bad, with no signs (even though I had all routine maintenance performed on it). By the time that they caught the problem, it was too late and the engine is fried. I don't even have 100,000 miles on the car but since it is used, they only warranty up to 60,000. Now I am out of a vehicle after only a year of ownership. It is absolutely ridiculous that the manufacturer would not help in this situation. They have had these issues and recalled over 100,00 of vehicles for this very thing. I will never buy another Hyundai."
"I own this car for almost 2 years, we like travel with the family, is fun to drive and enjoy also kids love the panoramic sunrood and good looking car, great overall!"
Value
Amazing car!  Standard features on the ultimates model exceeds anything comparable to Toyota or Honda!  Going on 3 years of ownership with absolutely no issues!  Highly recommend!
It’s a very luxurious car
Sporadic low clunking noise after making a turn
"I currently own this Tucson, and like my previous Hyundai Sonata, I am continuing t hear a low clunk noise after I have turned a corner and turn straightened the wheel. The noise is only sporadic and isn’t apparent each time I take a turn to the rest hut or left. I took it to the dealership five times and after fifth time (they kept it for five days,) they only found a cracked boot that they replaced. Thinking that would fix the problem, I got it back, only to find that tye problem still exists. The dealership is offering to buy it back, as of yesterday, they say due to low inventory of used cars on their lot."
"Utilitarian, practical"
"Wind noise, MPG"
"I own the 2021 Tucson. I’m really glad I snatched this generation up because the newest generation is just a mess of design. 

This Tucson is designed well. A high dash with modern styling. Good storage, nimble steering, and very pleasant over unruly roads. 

The wind noise is pronounced at any speed over 75 mph. MPG can be good depending on driving habits. I average 23 mpg typically combined. 

The trunk space is great. The load height is a little awkward but the trunk lid gets out of the way and makes loading easier.  

I don’t mind the plastic interior. It’s easier to clean and my dog can scratch it up and I won’t feel like I’m treating it badly. I can’t see myself in any other current CUV. Most of them have similar cargo space or more. It’s really about preference. I’ve owned a Hyundai before so I’m comfortable with the brand. Just go with what you like but this car is great."
"Great ride, quiet ride, many standard features"
"Electronics not reliable, needs more power"
"We really liked our 2020 Tucson until the problems started. We have the Limited version with all leather interior and all of the features that came standard were great. It rides great and is quieter than our last several vehicles. Financing was 0% for up to 84 months. Bought it new in June 2020. 3 months later the outside temperature sensor began showing it was below freezing when it was 80+ degrees outside preventing the air conditioner from running. After 3 trips to the dealer trying to diagnose the problem, replacing the ambient temperature sensor, and finally a computer control module, and the heater control, it was fixed. Ended up leaving it at the dealer for a total of 4 weeks. Things were good for almost a year then the remote start and other remote actions quit working. Dealer did diagnostic that showed no problems. Blue link uses the Verizon cell phone network (not satellite) and they told us we were in a weak reception area. However when we first got it the remote actions worked fine. Our daughter’s Hyundai works sitting next to ours that doesn’t even in a good reception area where she lives. Within a few days the touchscreen would only show the Hyundai symbol and the radio would play and go off constantly. Took it to the dealer and they ordered a new touchscreen/radio. Still waiting for the part and now the battery started going dead. Took it back to the dealer where it is right now. They suspect that the radio is shorting out and causing a drain on the battery. It also may be the problem with the remote actions. Can’t complain about the dealer’s service manager and service department as they have treated us very well giving us two different brand new loaner vehicles when they have kept our car and working to get the car fixed. But I believe we got a lemon that was built during the pandemic and we wonder what will be next, but we can’t afford to trade it without losing money."
Drive smoothly
No cons
Perfect condition. Low mileage. Barely used. Ready to drive. This car can be available within a day notice. Price is negotiable.
"Fast and nimble, great gas mileage; 37 mpg highway"
Radio speakers are not good...
"2016 Tucson Limited. This is probably the best car I have owned. Initially, the car had a hesitation problem; starting from a light or stop sign the car would hesitate. I complained a few times to the dealer but it continued. A year later they reinstalled the software for my transmission and the car has been perfect every since. I like the car and I like the dealer and intend to update to a new Tucson or Santa Fe within the next year."
No mechanical issues yet after 6k miles.
"2021 Tucson Limited FWD. 
~~Wife likes it, I hate it. My first major complaint is that the power driver's seat doesn't go down far enough, so I feel like I am always sitting on a booster seat that has me leaning forward into the windshield. Not to mention, at 5'10"" tall, for the same reason I have to contort my body and neck just to get in the vehicle! Unless you are 5'5"" or under (like my wife), the ergonomics of the driver's cabin are all wrong and very uncomfortable for a normal size person, especially for long trips! The driver's seat is also very bouncy feeling, and not very comfortable either.
Furthermore -  
~~The cell-phone battery charging feature never works consistently on any phone we have tried.
~~The electric brakes have no feel to them whatsoever. Terrible.
~~All the features of a Limited, yet there is NO compass (are you kidding me?!)!...lol.
~~The road noise, especially for a limited, is annoying as well. 
~~The blue-link stuff is only free for a short time, and then you have to pay up annually to access the same features that were free when you bought the car. *rolls eyes*. 
~~The engine is painfully under-powered even for people like me that don't need a more powerful engine to be happy. You will constantly find yourself having to nearly floor it to get it to downshift and actually accelerate at a normal pace. Then switch to 'sport mode' you say? Sure, then REALLY watch your mpg avg drop!
~~The cruise control, in it's basic, unassisted setting is HUGELY annoying, as it is very laggy and is  far more concerned about keeping you 3-4 mph UNDER the speed you set, than actually keeping your speed at your requested setting.
~~Under no circumstances has it even come close to the advertised mpg ratings for city or highway driving. I could go on... :( We will be trading it off very soon."
"Great driving experience, great gas mileage"
some road noise
"Very intuitive Car! Beautiful car styling and love the mohave sand color. Power everything, and the automatic lift hatchback is amazing. Everything about this car is smooth. Big car feel on the inside with midsize car handling abilities. Great features across the board. GREAT gas mileage. Super happy with my Tucson!"
Fun to drive
Design needs work
"The size is good, I just don't like the plain-looking hatch in the back. The weels and front end look ok. It could use some better performance driving"
NICE LOOKING
NOT RELIABLE
THIS TUSON HAS BEEN LIKE A LEMON. TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN.  THE SENSOR LIGHTS ARE ALL ON NOW. GOOD THING GOT 10YR-100 MILES WARRANTY.
"I bought this SUV (1.6T Premium/ Sport) brand new off the lot in Toronto and it has been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  

Its first 1200km were highway miles and I followed the advice in the manual for breaking in the engine to a tee by constantly varying my speed between 2000-4000 rpm's the whole way.  I also cycled through transmission modes (Eco, Normal & Sport) for short periods of time.  A few times along the way at speed though when I stepped on the gas on a straightaway the Turbo kicked in all wound up and this thing ripped! It was pretty awesome and will put a smile on your face, Lol.  However, the same thing cannot be said off the line which brings me to my next statement.

Once I got back into the city I did notice the odd DCT performance that some people have been complaining about in some reviews except I didn't even realize it was an issue.  I just thought it was the nature of this new style of transmission and adapted to its character accordingly, i.e. instead of ""stepping"" on the gas after stopping at a stop sign or red light I rolled the ball of my foot on the gas pedal and gradually eased into speed to overcome what would otherwise be a momentary lag.  If you tried to just step on the gas it would slowly veer ahead with not much pick up until it hit about 10 km/ hour.  Thus I learned not to try and jump in front of oncoming traffic.  Not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed by this but then as I got to know the vehicle even more something else happened which was...

Every now and then from a dead stop by stepping on the gas (after attempting to ease into it) the vehicle would suddenly pop or lurch a few feet forward and then start moving and also on the highway I noticed if I punched the transmission into Eco mode from normal the rpm would decrease by about 1500.  So I was mentally registering these things but was only thinking about how I could adapt to it.  

Well, after learning more online about the vehicle and reading what others were saying in reviews I eventually came to learn of the DCT computer module update that Hyundai was releasing to dealers to fix lag issues and then boom it all of a sudden started to make sense.  Turns out the vehicle sometimes wasn't fully gearing down into first gear and thus trying to start in second which caused these lags, lurches or delays.  I might add it didn't happen often but enough that it was noticeable.  Once the dealer performed the update, boom, problem solved! It just goes now but still is nothing to write home about off the line.  You can still roll the ball of your foot onto the pedal and take off nicely, it just isn't as pronounced as a regular automatic.  Once you start getting up to speed though the Turbo just kicks in and off you go.

After the awareness of the DCT lag went away the rest of the vehicle came into focus.  The cabin is pretty quiet, it rides really smoothly on the 19's and cornering is tight with no noticeable sway such as I experienced profoundly in a Nissan Rogue! There's responsive 3 stage heating in the seats and the steering wheel heats up too.  The electric driver's seat adjusts quickly (no memory setting) and I love the power lumbar.  The shifter is in the right spot and with a bit of fine tuning (at 5'11"") was able to adjust the seat such that I can easily rest my elbow on the centre console while driving.  Sometimes I like to grab the shifter though when going around a corner and the g-force will cause it to come over to the left and enter manual mode.  It would be nice if there was a little edge to prevent coming over such that you have to move the shifter up or down a little bit before it slides over.      

The centre console is ok but just barely provides an adequate amount of space.  I bought a divider off eBay meant for the Tucson because it's just an empty rectangular hole so there's no way to easily organize anything in there.  The glove box can hold a fair bit but doesn't lock.  I think it does on the 2017 now though.

There's a little cut out for your phone by the shifter but if you plug it in to charge the cord gets in the way and the phone doesn't sit in it properly.  I bought a vent clip to get around this and prefer it over using the cut out since it's closer to reach from hands on the wheel.  The front tray is nice and has enough room to throw some odds and ends onto it for easy reach as well.

The dual 12V outlets are great with an AUX and USB port in the middle.  I use one 12v outlet to power two extra USB ports and the other to plug in a Garmnin GPS or what have you.

I have the 5"" screen with Bluetooth and it sounds amazing with the right tunes.  One thing I plan to do is add an under seat subwoofer to fill out the low end just a little bit more and I know it will sound great.  Full voice recognition is available and the system has paired with every device I've thrown at it - ipad, blackberry, etc. - I run everything through my phone and didn't need the 8"" NAV  screen.  Voice for Google/ Blackberry maps
comes over the speakers loud and clear but can't switch to the radio at the same time since those features are dependent on Bluetooth audio.  Making calls is a breeze, just push a button on the steering wheel and announce who you want to call.  You can also easily slip into private mode if you're allowed to handle a phone in a vehicle while driving where you live (probably not). 

The seats also fit like a glove but one thing that doesn't impress all that much is the plastic on the dash and door panels.  I mean it's okay but it would be nice if softer material was used.  There's no shakes, rattles or creaking though so I'm good with it since I wanted to avoid leather seats, push button start and NAV and this trim was the highest I could go without those things.  The cloth seats have YES essentials protection and a few spilled things have already wiped off very easily.
 
Save yourself some money and go with the regular Tucson rubber mats that you can get from the dealer for $100 bucks instead of the $400 premium ones.  They're still great quality, custom fitting Tucson branded mats that just don't have that extra bit of lip that the premiums have or go over the transmission hump in the back.  

Another thing I noticed is that the MPG is constantly improving with this vehicle, easily hitting 6.9L/100km instead of the stated 8.5 - 9.9. In the city alone I'm hitting over 300 miles per tank.  On the Highway it's over 500 miles (Single Driver and a bit of cargo).  By the way, the cargo area has enough space for a trip or something but you won't be moving your apt. in it, at least not in a trip or two.  Think some luggage, camping gear and a mountain bike with the wheel taken off if you don't use a rack.

The factory tinted windows are a nice touch too and when this thing is clean it's a real head turner without coming off as pretentious.  There's a sold cover underneath protecting the entire engine from road debris and another full length cover underneath the rocker on the driver's side which makes a huge difference.  When I open the hood the engine is practically spotless, same with the compartment and is really easy to keep clean. 

Overall, it's just a fun SUV to drive with plenty of zip, great gas mileage, handling and styling.  My mom has a 2002 CRV and it's nothing but a brick in comparison though its cargo space is pretty much unmatched.

I have no problem recommending this vehicle and at least at the dealer I go to for service, I don't expect any problems obtaining warranty service should I ever require it based on interactions with the dept. manager so far.

Expenses incurred in Canada - $32 770 all in (13% HST included) for the 2016 1.6T Premium Sport with heated steering wheel/ mirrors, Dual zone Auto climate control, license plates and wheel locks.  

Block heater $190 installed, Four factory Tucson all weather rubber mats were $119, a factory all weather cargo mat $69 and four factory mud flaps $60 bucks.  Hope this helps!

p.s. oh yeah - sometimes I find with the seat adjustment I use that the A-Pillar on the passenger side sometimes blocks my field of view when looking in that direction but not very often, usually while browsing around at a red light or looking off to the right at some scenery down the highway, things like that"
